This highlights the importance of consistent units in data analysis.  The extremely low IC50 suggests potent activity against MCF7 cells in this specific assay/experiment.\n\n\nIn summary, the data describes the activity of several compounds against MCF7 breast carcinoma cells, revealing varying potencies and physicochemical properties.  Several compounds show violations of Lipinski's Rule of Five and some have Black Box Warnings, indicating potential toxicity concerns.  The inconsistent units for IC50 values (nM vs \u00b5g/mL) highlight a data quality issue."

Note that \"DrugConditions\" is empty for all entries in the provided data.\n\n**DrugID: DB00996**\n\n1. **Column Names and Values:** DrugID: DB00996, DrugName: Gabapentin, DrugDescription: Gabapentin is an anticonvulsant medication used in the management of peripheral neuropathic pains, postherpetic neuralgia, and partial-onset seizures., DrugTarget: ['P54289', 'Q9NY47', 'A0A024R8I1', 'Q00975', 'P30542', 'O43525', 'Q9NR82'], DrugPharmacodynamics: Gabapentin is an anti-convulsant medication that inhibits the release of excitatory neurotransmitters, allowing for its use against pathologic neurotransmission such as that seen in neuropathic pain and seizure disorders. It has a wide therapeutic index, with doses in excess of 8000 mg/kg failing to cause a fatal reaction in rats. Gabapentin is ineffective in absence seizures and should be used in caution in patients with mixed seizure disorders involving absence seizures. Gabapentin has been associated with drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS), otherwise known as multi-organ hypersensitivity. This reaction can prove fatal and early symptoms such as fever, lymphadenopathy, and rash should be promptly investigated., DrugSmile: NCC1(CC(O)=O)CCCCC1, DrugMechanism: The precise mechanism through which gabapentin exerts its therapeutic effects is unclear. The primary mode of action appears to be at the auxillary \u03b1\u03b4- subunit of voltage-gated calcium channels (though a low affinity for the \u03b1\u03b4- subunit has also been reported). The major function of these subunits is to facilitate the movement of pore-forming \u03b1 subunits of calcium channels from the endoplasmic reticulum to the cell membrane of pre-synaptic neurons. There is evidence that chronic pain states can cause an increase in the expression of \u03b1\u03b4 subunits and that these changes correlate with hyperalgesia. Gabapentin appears to inhibit the action of \u03b1\u03b4- subunits, thus decreasing the density of pre-synaptic voltage-gated calcium channels and subsequent release of excitatory neurotransmitters. It is likely that this inhibition is also responsible for the anti-epileptic action of gabapentin. There is some evidence that gabapentin also acts on adenosine receptors, and voltage-gated potassium channels, though the clinical relevance of its action at these sites is unclear., DrugConditions: [], DrugCategories: ['Acids, Acyclic', 'Acids, Carbocyclic', 'Amines', 'Amino Acids', 'Amino Acids, Peptides, and Proteins', 'Aminobutyrates', 'Analgesics', 'Anti-epileptic Agent', 'Anticonvulsants', 'Butyrates', 'Central Nervous System Agents', 'Central Nervous System Depressants', 'Cyclohexanecarboxylic Acids', 'Cyclohexanes', 'Cycloparaffins', 'Decreased Central Nervous System Disorganized Electrical Activity', 'Drugs causing inadvertant photosensitivity', 'Gabapentin and Prodrugs', 'Gabapentinoids', 'Miscellaneous Anticonvulsants', 'Nervous System', 'Neurotransmitter Agents', 'Peripheral Nervous System Agents', 'Photosensitizing Agents', 'Psychotropic Drugs', 'Sensory System Agents', 'Tranquilizing Agents']\n\n2. **Seamless Sentence:** Gabapentin (DB00996), an anticonvulsant used for neuropathic pain, postherpetic neuralgia, and seizures, targets several proteins (['P54289', 'Q9NY47', etc.]) and primarily acts by inhibiting excitatory neurotransmitter release via voltage-gated calcium channels, although its mechanism isn't fully understood, and it also shows activity at adenosine and potassium channels; its wide therapeutic index is notable, but it carries a risk of DRESS syndrome, and it's categorized under various pharmacological classes including analgesics, anticonvulsants, and central nervous system agents.\n\n3. **Summary Statement:** Gabapentin is a broadly used anticonvulsant with a complex mechanism of action, primarily targeting voltage-gated calcium channels, but also potentially other receptors.  While generally safe with a wide therapeutic index, it has a serious side effect profile including the potentially fatal DRESS syndrome.\n\n\n**DrugID: DB01083**\n\n1. **Column Names and Values:** DrugID: DB01083, DrugName: Orlistat, DrugDescription: Orlistat is a reversible inhibitor of gastrointestinal lipases indicated for weight loss and weight maintenance., DrugTarget: ['P16233', 'P07098', 'P49327'], DrugPharmacodynamics: Orlistat helps with weight reduction and maintenance by inhibiting the absorption of dietary fats via the inhibition of lipase enzymes., DrugSmile: CCCCCCCCCCC[C@@H](C[C@@H]1OC(=O)[C@H]1CCCCCC)OC(=O)[C@H](CC(C)C)NC=O, DrugMechanism: Orlistat is a potent and selective inhibitor of various lipase enzymes responsible for the metabolism of fat. It acts in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract via covalent binding to the serine residues located on the active site of both gastric and pancreatic lipase. When orlistat is taken with food containing fat, it partially inhibits the hydrolysis of triglycerides. This decreases absorption of monoaclglycerides and free fatty acids, contributing to weight maintenance and weight loss., DrugConditions: ['Weight Reduction'], DrugCategories: ['Alimentary Tract and Metabolism', 'Anti-Obesity Agents', 'Antiobesity Preparations, Excl.

It binds to the 30S ribosomal subunit and prevents the amino-acyl tRNA from binding to the A site of the ribosome. It also binds to some extent to the 50S ribosomal subunit. This binding is reversible in nature. Additionally tetracycline may alter the cytoplasmic membrane of bacteria causing leakage of intracellular contents, such as nucleotides, from the cell., DrugSmile: [H][C@@]12C[C@@]3([H])C(=C(O)[C@]1(O)C(=O)C(C(N)=O)=C(O)[C@H]2N(C)C)C(=O)C1=C(O)C=CC=C1[C@@]3(C)O, DrugMechanism: Tetracycline passively diffuses through porin channels in the bacterial membrane and reversibly binds to the S ribosomal subunit, preventing binding of tRNA to the mRNA-ribosome complex, and thus interfering with protein synthesis., DrugConditions: [], DrugCategories: ['Agents that produce neuromuscular block (indirect)', 'Alimentary Tract and Metabolism', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents', 'Anti-Infective Agents', 'Antibacterials for Systemic Use', 'Antibiotics for Topical Use', 'Antiinfectives and Antiseptics for Local Oral Treatment', 'Antiinfectives for Systemic Use', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A Inhibitors', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A Substrates', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A4 Inhibitors', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A4 Inhibitors (strength unknown)', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A4 Substrates', 'Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme Inhibitors', 'Cytochrome P-450 Substrates', 'Dermatologicals', 'Drugs causing inadvertant photosensitivity', 'Drugs for Acid Related Disorders', 'Drugs for Peptic Ulcer and Gastro-Oesophageal Reflux Disease (Gord)', 'Drugs that are Mainly Renally Excreted', 'Enzyme Inhibitors', 'Naphthacenes', 'OAT1/SLC22A6 inhibitors', 'OAT3/SLC22A8 Inhibitors', 'OAT3/SLC22A8 Substrates', 'Ophthalmological and Otological Preparations', 'Ophthalmologicals', 'Organic Anion Transporting Polypeptide 2B1 Inhibitors', 'Otologicals', 'Photosensitizing Agents', 'Protein Synthesis Inhibitors', 'Sensory Organs', 'Stomatological Preparations', 'Tetracyclines']\n\n2. **Seamless Sentence:** Tetracycline (DB00759), a broad-spectrum antibiotic targeting various bacterial proteins (['P02359', 'P0AG59', etc.]), inhibits bacterial protein synthesis by reversibly binding to the 30S ribosomal subunit, preventing tRNA binding and potentially disrupting the cytoplasmic membrane;  its mechanism involves passive diffusion across the bacterial membrane and is classified under numerous categories including anti-bacterial agents, protein synthesis inhibitors, and various cytochrome P450 related classes.\n\n3. **Summary Statement:** Tetracycline's mechanism of action is well-characterized, involving ribosomal binding and inhibition of protein synthesis. Its broad-spectrum activity and various other effects make it a versatile antibiotic, although it falls under many categories due to its diverse effects.\n\n\n**DrugID: DB00740**\n\n1. **Column Names and Values:** DrugID: DB00740, DrugName: Riluzole, DrugDescription: Riluzole is a glutamate antagonist used to treat amyotrophic lateral sclerosis., DrugTarget: ['Q14524', 'Q9UPY5'], DrugPharmacodynamics: Riluzole, a member of the benzothiazole class, is indicated for the treatment of patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Riluzole extends survival and/or time to tracheostomy. It is also neuroprotective in various in vivo experimental models of neuronal injury involving excitotoxic mechanisms. The etiology and pathogenesis of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) are not known, although a number of hypotheses have been advanced. One hypothesis is that motor neurons, made vulnerable through either genetic predisposition or environmental factors, are injured by glutamate. In some cases of familial ALS the enzyme superoxide dismutase has been found to be defective., DrugSmile: NC1=NC2=C(S1)C=C(OC(F)(F)F)C=C2, DrugMechanism: The mode of action of riluzole is unknown. Its pharmacological properties include the following, some of which may be related to its effect: ) an inhibitory effect on glutamate release (activation of glutamate reuptake), ) inactivation of voltage-dependent sodium channels, and ) ability to interfere with intracellular events that follow transmitter binding at excitatory amino acid receptors., DrugConditions: [], DrugCategories: ['Anticonvulsants', 'BCRP/ABCG2 Substrates', 'Benzothiazoles', 'Central Nervous System Agents', 'Central Nervous System Depressants', 'Compounds used in a research, industrial, or household setting', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP1A2 Substrates', 'Cytochrome P-450 Substrates', 'Excitatory Amino Acid Agents', 'Excitatory Amino Acid Antagonists', 'Heterocyclic Compounds, Fused-Ring', 'Miscellaneous Central Nervous System Agents', 'Nervous System', 'Neuroprotective Agents', 'Neurotransmitter Agents', 'Protective Agents', 'Sulfur Compounds', 'Thiazoles']\n\n2. **Seamless Sentence:** Riluzole (DB00740), a benzothiazole used in ALS treatment, targets proteins ['Q14524', 'Q9UPY5'] and may act through mechanisms including glutamate release inhibition, sodium channel inactivation, and interference with intracellular events following excitatory amino acid receptor binding, although its precise mechanism remains unclear; it shows neuroprotective effects and is categorized as a central nervous system agent and glutamate antagonist.\n\n3. **Summary Statement:** Riluzole's mechanism of action in ALS is not fully elucidated, but it appears to modulate glutamate activity and sodium channels, providing neuroprotective effects.  Further research is needed to fully understand its precise mechanism.\n\n\n**DrugID: DB14509**\n\n1. **Column Names and Values:** DrugID: DB14509, DrugName: Lithium carbonate, DrugDescription: Lithium carbonate is a medication used to treat manic episodes of bipolar disorder., DrugTarget: ['O14732', 'P29218', 'P49841', 'P42263'], DrugPharmacodynamics: Lithium's mechanism of action is still unknown. Lithium's therapeutic action may be due to a number of effects, ranging from inhibition of enzymes such as glycogen synthase kinase 3, inositol phosphatases, or modulation of glutamate receptors., DrugSmile: [Li+].[Li+].[O-]C([O-])=O, DrugMechanism: Lithium's mechanism of action is still unknown. However, the \u201cinositol depletion theory\u201d suggests main potential targets. These targets are inositol monophosphatase, inositol polyphosphatase, and glycogen synthase kinase (GSK-),.The \u201cInositol depletion theory\u201d suggests lithium behaves as an uncompetitive inhibitor of inositol monophosphatase in a manner inversely proportional to the degree of stimulus. This inhibition lowers levels of inositol triphosphate. However, stronger inhibitors of inositol monophosphatase are not as clinically effective and low levels of inositol triphosphate are associated with memory impairment,.Lithium acts on inositol polyphosphatase as an uncompetitive inhibitor. This inhibition is thought to have multiple downstream effects that have yet to be clarified.Lithium regulates phosphorylation of GSK- which regulates other enzymes through phosphorylation. Lithium can also inhibit GSK- through interfering with the magnesium ion in the active site., DrugConditions: [], DrugCategories: ['Acids', 'Acids, Noncarboxylic', 'Alkalies', 'Anions', 'Antidepressive Agents', 'Antimanic Agents', 'Carbon Compounds, Inorganic', 'Carbonates', 'Carbonic Acid', 'Central Nervous System Agents', 'Central Nervous System Depressants', 'Drugs that are Mainly Renally Excreted', 'Drugs that are Mainly Renally Excreted with a Narrow Therapeutic Index', 'Electrolytes', 'Enzyme Inhibitors', 'Ions', 'Lithium Compounds', 'Mood Stabilizer', 'Narrow Therapeutic Index Drugs', 'Nephrotoxic agents', 'Nervous System', 'Neurotoxic agents', 'Psycholeptics', 'Psychotropic Drugs', 'QTc Prolonging Agents', 'Serotonergic Drugs Shown to Increase Risk of Serotonin Syndrome', 'Serotonin Agents', 'Serotonin Modulators', 'Tranquilizing Agents']\n\n2. **Seamless Sentence:** Lithium carbonate (DB14509), used to treat bipolar mania, targets proteins (['O14732', 'P29218', etc.]) and its mechanism, while unclear, may involve the inhibition of enzymes like inositol monophosphatase and glycogen synthase kinase, potentially impacting inositol triphosphate levels; although the exact mechanism is still under investigation, it's classified as an antimanic agent, mood stabilizer, and falls under several categories related to central nervous system effects and electrolyte balance.\n\n3. **Summary Statement:** Lithium carbonate's mechanism of action in treating bipolar disorder remains incompletely understood, but likely involves modulation of several enzymes and signaling pathways.

Alkylating agents are so named because of their ability to add alkyl groups to many electronegative groups under conditions present in cells. They stop tumor growth by cross-linking guanine bases in DNA double-helix strands - directly attacking DNA. This makes the strands unable to uncoil and separate. As this is necessary in DNA replication, the cells can no longer divide. In addition, these drugs add methyl or other alkyl groups onto molecules where they do not belong which in turn inhibits their correct utilization by base pairing and causes a miscoding of DNA.

This response later declines to baseline with long-term use of atenolol. More importantly, this reduction in the work demanded of the myocardium also reduces oxygen demand which provides therapeutic benefit by reducing the mismatch of oxygen supply and demand in settings where coronary blood flow is limited, such as in coronary atherosclerosis. Reducing oxygen demand, particularly due to exercise, can reduce the frequency of angina pectoris symptoms and potentially improve survival of the remaining myocardium after myocardial infarction. The decrease in rate of sinoatrial node potentials, electrical conduction, slowing of potentials traveling through the atrioventricular node, and reduced frequency of ectopic potentials due to blockade of adrenergic beta receptors has led to benefit in arrhythmic conditions such as atrial fibrillation by controlling the rate of action potential generation and allowing for more effective coordinated contractions. Since a degree of sympathetic activity is necessary to maintain cardiac function, the reduced contractility induced by atenolol may precipitate or worsen heart failure, especially during volume overload.LabelThe effects of atenolol on blood pressure have been established, although it is less effective than alternative beta-blockers, but the mechanism has not yet been characterized.Label,24As a \u03b21 selective drug, it does not act via the vasodilation produced by non-selective agents.24Despite this there is a sustained reduction in peripheral vascular resistance, and consequently blood pressure, alongside a decrease in cardiac output. It is thought that atenolol's antihypertensive activity may be related to action on the central nervous system (CNS) or it's inhibition of the renin-aldosterone-angiotensin system rather than direct effects on the vasculature.LabelAtenolol produces CNS effects similar to other beta-blockers, but does so to a lesser extent due to reduces ability to cross the blood-brain barrier.24It has the potential to produce fatigue, depression, and sleep disturbances such as nightmares or insomnia.Label,24The exact mechanisms behind these have not been characterized but their occurrence must be considered as they represent clinically relevant adverse effects.Atenolol exerts some effects on the respiratory system although to a much lesser extent than non-selective beta-blockers.LabelInteraction with \u03b22 receptors in the airways can produce bronchoconstriction by blocking the relaxation of bronchial smooth muscle mediated by the sympathetic nervous system.24The same action can interfere with \u03b2-agonist therapies used in asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.Label,14,24Unlike some other beta-blocker drugs, atenolol does not have intrinsic sympathomimetic or membrane stabilizing activity nor does it produce changes in glycemic control.Label, DrugSmile: CC(C)NCC(O)COC1=CC=C(CC(N)=O)C=C1, DrugMechanism: Atenolol is a cardioselective beta-blocker, called such because it selectively binds to the \u03b2-adrenergic receptor as an antagonist up to a reported  fold more than \u03b2 receptors.Selective activity at the \u03b2 receptor produces cardioselectivity due to the higher population of this receptor in cardiac tissue. Some binding to \u03b2 and possibly \u03b2 receptors can still occur at therapeutic dosages but the effects mediated by antagonizing these are significantly reduced from those of non-selective agents. \u03b2 and \u03b2 receptors are Gscoupled therefore antagonism of their activation reduces activity of adenylyl cyclase and its downstream signalling via cyclic adenosime monophosphate and protein kinase A (PKA).In cardiomyocytes PKA is thought to mediate activation of L-type calcium channels and ryanodine receptors through their phosphorylation.L-type calcium channels can then provide an initial rise in intracellular calcium and trigger the ryanodine receptors to release calcium stored in the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) and increased contractility. PKA also plays a role in the cessation of contraction by phosphorylating phospholamban which in turn increases the affinity of SR Ca+ATPase to increase reuptake of calcium into the SR. It also phophorylates troponin I to reduce affinity of the protein for calcium. Both of these events lead to a reduction in contraction which, when coupled with the initial increase in contraction, allows for faster cycling and consequently higher heart rate with increased contractility. L-type calcium channels are also a major contributor to cardiac depolarization and their activation can increase frequency of action potentials and possibly the incidence of ectopic potentials.Similar inihibitory events occur in the bronchial smooth muscle to mediate relaxation including phosphorylation of myosin light-chain kinase, reducing its affinity for calcium.PKA also inhibits the excitatory Gqcoupled pathway by phosphorylating the inositol trisphosphate receptor and phospholipase C resulting in inhibition of intracellular calcium release. Antagonism of this activity by beta-blocker agents like atenolol can thus cause increased bronchoconstriction., TargetActionsOrganism: ABeta- adrenergic receptor antagonist Humans, UBeta- adrenergic receptor antagonist Humans, DrugConditions: [], DrugCategories: ['Adrenergic Agents', 'Adrenergic Antagonists', 'Adrenergic beta-1 Receptor Antagonists', 'Adrenergic beta-Antagonists', 'Agents causing hyperkalemia', 'Alcohols', 'Amines', 'Amino Alcohols', 'Antiarrhythmic agents', 'Antihypertensive Agents', 'Antihypertensive Agents Indicated for Hypertension', 'Autonomic Agents', 'Beta blocking agents and calcium channel blockers', 'Beta Blocking Agents and Thiazides', 'Beta Blocking Agents, Selective', 'Beta Blocking Agents, Selective, and Thiazides', 'Beta-Blockers (Beta1 Selective)', 'Bradycardia-Causing Agents', 'BSEP/ABCB11 Substrates', 'Cardiovascular Agents', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP2D6 Substrates', 'Cytochrome P-450 Substrates', 'Hypotensive Agents', 'Peripheral Nervous System Agents', 'QTc shortening agents', 'Sympatholytics']\n\n2. **Sentence Description:** Atenolol (DB00335), a beta-1 selective blocker used to treat hypertension, angina, and myocardial infarction, targets the proteins P08588 and P07550 and acts as a beta-adrenergic receptor antagonist, reducing heart rate and contractility by blocking sympathetic innervation, thereby decreasing myocardial oxygen demand and potentially improving survival after infarction; its chemical structure is CC(C)NCC(O)COC1=CC=C(CC(N)=O)C=C1, and it's categorized as a beta-blocker, antihypertensive agent, and cardiovascular agent, among other classifications reflecting its effects on the cardiovascular and nervous systems.\n\n3. **Summary Statement:** Atenolol is a cardioselective beta-blocker primarily used for cardiovascular indications.

Firstly, DHE's s agonist action on -hydroxytryptamine (HT) b receptors in the smooth muscle of the cranial vasculature may provide relief via vasoconstriction of the blood vessels which typically become dilated due to the release of CGRP during migraine attacks.,DHE's off-target action at alpha-adrenergic receptors may further contribute via this mechanism. The remaining mechanisms are thought to provide relief through the effects on the neurogenic causes of migraine symptoms. Agonist action by DHE on -HTband -HTdreceptors inhibits nociceptive signalling through the ventroposteromedial thalamus to the trigeminal sensory neurons. Further action on -HTband -HTdreceptors with the addition of agonist activity on -HTfin the trigeminal nucleus caudalis decreases afferent signalling to trigeminal sensory neurons which contributes to central sensitization. The success of experimental compounds selectively targetting the -HTfreceptor lends support to this mechanism. Lastly, action at -HTdreceptors on trigeminal nerve terminals inhibits the release of vasoactive neuropeptides thought to contribute to pain and inflammation during a migraine attack. DHE is known to have -fold less potency at the -HTbreceptor than its predecessor ergotamine which reduces the incidence of vascular side effects.Notably, DHE slowly diffuses from receptors resulting in unreliable prediction of effects from plasma concentration., TargetActionsOrganism: A-hydroxytryptamine receptor B agonist Humans, A-hydroxytryptamine receptor D agonist Humans, A-hydroxytryptamine receptor F agonist Humans, UAlpha-A adrenergic receptor agonist Humans, U-hydroxytryptamine receptor A agonist Humans, U-hydroxytryptamine receptor E agonist Humans, U-hydroxytryptamine receptor A agonist Humans, U-hydroxytryptamine receptor B agonist Humans, U-hydroxytryptamine receptor C agonist Humans, UAlpha- adrenergic receptors agonist Humans, UAlpha- adrenergic receptors agonist Humans, UDopamine D receptor agonist Humans, UDopamine D receptor agonist Humans, UDopamine D receptor agonist Humans, U-hydroxytryptamine receptor agonist Humans, UBeta- adrenergic receptor agonist Humans, DrugConditions: [], DrugCategories: ['Adrenergic alpha-1 Receptor Antagonists', 'Adrenergic alpha-Antagonists', 'Adrenergic Antagonists', 'Agents that produce hypertension', 'Alkaloids', 'Analgesics', 'Antidepressive Agents', 'Antimigraine Preparations', 'Cardiovascular Agents', 'Central Nervous System Agents', 'Central Nervous System Depressants', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A Inhibitors', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A Substrates', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A4 Inhibitors', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A4 Inhibitors (strength unknown)', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A4 Substrates', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A4 Substrates with a Narrow Therapeutic Index', 'Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme Inhibitors', 'Cytochrome P-450 Substrates', 'Dopamine Agents', 'Dopamine Agonists', 'Ergot Alkaloids and Derivatives', 'Ergot-derivative Dopamine Receptor Agonists', 'Ergotamine Derivative', 'Ergotamines', 'Heterocyclic Compounds, Fused-Ring', 'Narrow Therapeutic Index Drugs', 'Nervous System', 'Neurotransmitter Agents', 'P-glycoprotein inhibitors', 'Peripheral Nervous System Agents', 'Sensory System Agents', 'Serotonergic Drugs Shown to Increase Risk of Serotonin Syndrome', 'Serotonin 5-HT1 Receptor Agonists', 'Serotonin 5-HT2 Receptor Agonists', 'Serotonin Agents', 'Serotonin Modulators', 'Serotonin Receptor Agonists', 'Sympatholytic (Adrenergic Blocking) Agents', 'Vasoconstrictor Agents']\n\n2. **Sentence Description:** Dihydroergotamine (DB00320), an ergot alkaloid used to treat migraine and cluster headaches, targets numerous proteins (P28222, P28221, P30939, etc.) and exerts its effects through both neurological and vascular mechanisms, including serotonin receptor agonism, which may decrease trigeminal system activity and cause vasoconstriction, counteracting migraine-associated vasodilation; its chemical structure is represented by the SMILES string [H][C@@]12CCCN1C(=O)[C@H](CC1=CC=CC=C1)N1C(=O)[C@](C)(NC(=O)[C@H]3CN(C)[C@]4([H])CC5=CNC6=CC=CC(=C56)[C@@]4([H])C3)O[C@@]21O, and it is classified as an antimigraine preparation, ergot alkaloid, and vasoconstrictor agent, among other categories.\n\n3. **Summary Statement:** Dihydroergotamine is an antimigraine drug with a complex mechanism involving both vasoconstriction and modulation of neurotransmission in the trigeminal system.

It is through the downstream effects of 5-HT1B/1Dactivation that triptans are proposed to provide acute relief of migraines.14,1,2Zolmitriptan is also a vasoconstrictor,5leading to possible adverse cardiovascular effects such as myocardial ischemia/infarction, arrhythmias, cerebral and subarachnoid hemorrhage, stroke, gastrointestinal ischemia, and peripheral vasospastic reactions. In addition, chest/throat/neck/jaw pain, tightness, and/or pressure has been reported, along with the possibility of medication overuse headaches and serotonin syndrome. Patients with phenylketonuria should be advised that ZOMIG-ZMT contains phenylalanine.14, DrugSmile: CN(C)CCC1=CNC2=CC=C(C[C@H]3COC(=O)N3)C=C12, DrugMechanism: Migraines are complex physiological events characterized by unilateral throbbing headaches combined with photophobia and other aversions to sensory input. Migraine attacks are generally divided into phases: the premonitory phase, which typically involves irritability, fatigue, yawning, and stiff neck; the headache phase, which lasts for between four and  hours; and the postdrome phase, which lasts for up to a day following resolution of pain and whose symptoms are similar to those of the premonitory phase. In addition, neurological deficits, collectively termed migraine aura, may precede the headache phase.,The underlying pathophysiology of migraines is a matter of active research but involves both neurological and vascular components. The head pain associated with migraine is thought to be a consequence of activation of the nociceptive nerves comprising the trigeminocervical complex (TCC).Terminals of nociceptive nerves that innervate the dura matter release vasoactive peptides, such as calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), resulting in cranial vasodilation. Finally, when present, migraine aura appears to correlate with a transient wave(s) of cortical depolarization, termed cortical spreading depression (CSD).,Triptans, including zolmitriptan, are proposed to act in three ways. The main mechanism is through modulation of nociceptive nerve signalling in the central nervous system through -HTB/Dreceptors throughout the TCC and associated areas of the brain. In addition, triptans can enhance vasoconstriction, both through direct -HTB-mediated dilation of cranial blood vessels,,as well as through -HTD-mediated suppression of CGRP release.,Although triptans are classically described solely in terms of their effects on -HTB/Dreceptors, they also act as -HTFagonists as well. This -HT subtype is also found throughout the TCC, but is not present appreciably in cerebral vasculature; the significance of triptan-mediated -HTFactivation is currently not well described.Additionally, CSD that initiates in the ipsilateral parietal region may exert its effects in a manner that relies on -HTB/Dreceptor activation, suggesting that triptans may have some effect on CSD-mediated symptoms., TargetActionsOrganism: A-hydroxytryptamine receptor B agonist Humans, A-hydroxytryptamine receptor D agonist Humans, A-hydroxytryptamine receptor F agonist Humans, U-hydroxytryptamine receptor E agonist Humans, N-hydroxytryptamine receptor agonist Humans, N-hydroxytryptamine receptor A agonist Humans, N-hydroxytryptamine receptor A agonist Humans, N-hydroxytryptamine receptor B agonist Humans, DrugConditions: [], DrugCategories: ['Agents that produce hypertension', 'Amines', 'Analgesics', 'Antidepressive Agents', 'Antimigraine Preparations', 'Biogenic Amines', 'Biogenic Monoamines', 'Central Nervous System Depressants', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP1A2 Substrates', 'Cytochrome P-450 Substrates', 'Heterocyclic Compounds, Fused-Ring', 'Indoles', 'Monoamine Oxidase A Substrates', 'Nervous System', 'Neurotransmitter Agents', 'Oxazoles', 'Selective Serotonin 5-HT1 Receptor Agonists', 'Selective Serotonin Agonists', 'Serotonergic Drugs Shown to Increase Risk of Serotonin Syndrome', 'Serotonin 1b Receptor Agonists', 'Serotonin 1d Receptor Agonists', 'Serotonin 5-HT1 Receptor Agonists', 'Serotonin Agents', 'Serotonin Modulators', 'Serotonin Receptor Agonists', 'Serotonin-1b and Serotonin-1d Receptor Agonist', 'Triptans']\n\n2. **Sentence Description:** Zolmitriptan (DB00315), a triptan used to treat migraine, targets serotonin receptors (5-HT1B, 5-HT1D, 5-HT1F) and acts as an agonist, modulating nociceptive signaling in the trigeminocervical complex and potentially affecting cortical spreading depression; it also causes vasoconstriction, leading to potential cardiovascular side effects;  its chemical structure is CN(C)CCC1=CNC2=CC=C(C[C@H]3COC(=O)N3)C=C12, and it is classified as a triptan, antimigraine agent, and serotonin receptor agonist, among other categories related to its effects on the nervous system and its potential cardiovascular effects.\n\n3. **Summary Statement:** Zolmitriptan is a triptan used for acute migraine treatment.

It plays an important role in signal transduction pathways, where it acts as a second messenger, in neurotransmitter release from neurons, contraction of all muscle cell types, and fertilization. Many enzymes require calcium ions as a cofactor, those of the blood-clotting cascade being notable examples. Extracellular calcium is also important for maintaining the potential difference across excitable cell membranes, as well as proper bone formation., DrugSmile: [Ca], DrugMechanism: Calcium plays a vital role in the anatomy, physiology and biochemistry of organisms and of the cell, particularly in signal transduction pathways. More than  human proteins are known to bind or transport calcium. The skeleton acts as a major mineral storage site for the element and releases Ca+ ions into the bloodstream under controlled conditions. Circulating calcium is either in the free, ionized form or bound to blood proteins such as serum albumin. Parathyroid hormone (secreted from the parathyroid gland) regulates the resorption of Ca+ from bone. Calcitonin stimulates incorporation of calcium in bone, although this process is largely independent of calcitonin. Although calcium flow to and from the bone is neutral, about  mmol is turned over a day. Bone serves as an important storage point for calcium, as it contains % of the total body calcium. Low calcium intake may also be a risk factor in the development of osteoporosis. The best-absorbed form of calcium from a pill is a calcium salt like carbonate or phosphate. Calcium gluconate and calcium lactate are absorbed well by pregnant women. Seniors absorb calcium lactate, gluconate and citrate better unless they take their calcium supplement with a full breakfast. The currently recommended calcium intake is , milligrams per day for women not taking estrogen and  milligrams per day for women on estrogen. There is close to  milligrams of calcium in one cup of fluid milk.

However, there is considerable variation in their XLogP values and structural complexity.  The compounds with higher XLogP values (CID 2744870, 135419065) tend to have higher molecular weights and greater structural complexity, suggesting that lipophilicity may be a factor influencing these properties. Further investigation is needed to determine the relationship between structure, lipophilicity, and activity."
