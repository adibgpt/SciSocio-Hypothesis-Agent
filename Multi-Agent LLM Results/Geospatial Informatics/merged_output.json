This high vulnerability stemmed from very high susceptibility (63.34, Very High category), extremely high lack of coping capabilities (91.2), and high lack of adaptive capacities (62.72), resulting in a moderate WRI of 7.18 (Medium category).  Despite low exposure, the Central African Republic faced a severe water risk due to extremely limited coping and adaptive capacities.\n\n\n**Marokko (2011):** In Morocco in 2011, a medium level of exposure (13.41) coupled with a medium vulnerability score (53.49, Medium category) resulted in a moderate WRI of 7.17 (Medium category). This medium vulnerability was a consequence of medium susceptibility (29.72, Medium category), high lack of coping capabilities (77.12), and moderate lack of adaptive capacities (53.64). Morocco showed a moderate level of water risk, balanced between exposure and vulnerability components.\n\n\n**Eritrea (2011):** In Eritrea in 2011, the low exposure (9.9) contrasted sharply with the very high vulnerability (72.88, Very High category), resulting in a moderate WRI of 7.22 (Medium category). This high vulnerability was due to very high susceptibility (67.17, Very High category), high lack of coping capabilities (87.68), and substantial lack of adaptive capacities (63.79).  Similar to the Central African Republic, Eritrea's high vulnerability, despite low exposure, points to significant challenges in managing water resources."

This suggests that while exposure to water-related hazards is high, the country's vulnerability stems largely from limited capacity to manage and adapt to these risks.\n\n**Thailand (2011):** Thailand in 2011 exhibited a medium WRI (6.86), high exposure (14.84), and medium vulnerability (46.25). Despite high exposure, its susceptibility was low (22.44), but a substantial lack of coping (76.23) and moderate lack of adaptive capacities (40.1) contributed significantly to its overall vulnerability. This highlights the importance of coping mechanisms in mitigating water risk, even with relatively low susceptibility.\n\n**Turkmenistan (2011):** Turkmenistan's 2011 data shows a medium WRI (6.95), medium exposure (13.77), and medium vulnerability (50.44), although susceptibility was low (21.64).  However, the extremely high lack of coping capacities (79.27) and high lack of adaptive capacities (50.43) are major contributors to its vulnerability score.  This suggests that despite moderate exposure and low susceptibility, the absence of effective coping and adaptation strategies significantly elevates the country's overall water risk.\n\n**Armenia (2011):** In 2011, Armenia had a medium WRI (6.9), high exposure (14.67), and medium vulnerability (47.01), with medium susceptibility (26.27).  The considerable lack of coping (70.11) and moderate lack of adaptive capacities (44.64) indicate that improvements in these areas are crucial for reducing water risk. This signifies that while exposure is high, the manageable susceptibility is offset by weaknesses in coping and adaptation.\n\n\n**Comoros (2011):** The Comoros Islands in 2011 displayed a medium WRI (6.93) but very high vulnerability (68.6) and very high susceptibility (51.13) despite low exposure (10.1).  This extremely high vulnerability is primarily attributed to exceptionally high lacks of coping (85.92) and adaptive capacities (68.75). This indicates a critical need for improved coping and adaptation strategies to address the significant water risk, despite relatively low exposure."

Overall vulnerability was 49.03 (Medium category), composed of susceptibility at 30.81 (Medium category), a lack of coping capabilities at 75.75, and a lack of adaptive capacities at 40.52.  This suggests that while exposure is moderate, the high lack of coping capabilities contributes significantly to the overall medium vulnerability level.\n\n\n**Jemen (2011):**  Yemen in 2011 exhibited a WRI of 6.83 (Medium category) despite low exposure (10.23), suggesting other factors heavily influence the water risk.  High vulnerability (66.76, Very High category) was primarily driven by extremely low coping capabilities (87.27) and a substantial lack of adaptive capacities (65.7), resulting in high susceptibility (47.3, High category). The high vulnerability is noteworthy despite relatively low exposure.\n\n\n**Aserbaidschan (2011):** In Aserbaidschan during 2011, the WRI was 6.8 (Medium category), with moderate exposure (13.9, Medium category) and moderate vulnerability (48.94, Medium category). This vulnerability stemmed from moderate susceptibility (32.64, Medium category), along with a lack of coping capabilities (68.01) and adaptive capacities (46.16), both contributing to the overall medium vulnerability level.  The relatively balanced scores across different vulnerability components suggest a more manageable water risk profile compared to Yemen.\n\n\n**\u00c4quatorialguinea (2011):** \u00c4quatorialguinea in 2011 had a WRI of 6.72 (Medium category) despite low exposure (11.71, Low category).  High vulnerability (57.36, High category) arose from high susceptibility (34.82, High category) and significantly low coping (87.01) and adaptive capacities (50.25).  Similar to Yemen, the high vulnerability is noteworthy given the relatively low exposure, indicating significant underlying vulnerabilities.\n\n\n**Trinidad und Tobago (2011):** Trinidad und Tobago, in 2011, showed a WRI of 6.7 (Medium category) but with high exposure (15.97, High category).  However,  low vulnerability (41.98, Low category) was observed due to low susceptibility (20.1, Low category) and relatively better coping (68.6) and adaptive capacities (37.22). This suggests effective coping mechanisms and adaptive capacities mitigate the impact of high exposure."

Significantly,  a lack of coping capabilities (61.33) was higher than the lack of adaptive capacities (38.35), suggesting that improving coping mechanisms would be more impactful than enhancing adaptive capacities in reducing water risk.  The overall assessment suggests a situation of moderate risk where immediate coping strategies are more critical than long-term adaptation.\n\n**Mexico (2011):** In Mexico in 2011, a Water Risk Index (WRI) of 6.53 (categorized as Medium) alongside high exposure (14.75) and low vulnerability (44.27) with medium susceptibility (24.52) indicated a moderate water risk profile.  The lack of coping capabilities (70.13) was considerably higher than the lack of adaptive capacities (38.17), similar to Romania, highlighting the importance of focusing on immediate response mechanisms.  Despite high exposure, low vulnerability suggests effective existing coping mechanisms, though improvements are needed.\n\n**Malaysia (2011):** In Malaysia in 2011, a Water Risk Index (WRI) of 6.69 (categorized as Medium) along with high exposure (15.59), low vulnerability (42.88), and low susceptibility (20.12) indicated a moderate water risk.  A high lack of coping capabilities (69.45) relative to the lack of adaptive capacities (39.06) again points to the need for improved immediate response strategies.  Compared to Romania and Mexico, Malaysia shows lower vulnerability and susceptibility despite similar levels of exposure and lack of coping capabilities.\n\n**China (2011):** In China in 2011, a Water Risk Index (WRI) of 6.36 (categorized as Medium) with medium exposure (12.89) and medium vulnerability (49.3) and susceptibility (31.44) indicated a moderate water risk.  The high lack of coping capabilities (73.62) compared to the lack of adaptive capacities (42.85) suggests that strengthening immediate responses is a priority. China's medium vulnerability despite a lower exposure than other countries suggests inherent vulnerabilities in its water management systems.\n\n**Namibia (2011):**  In Namibia in 2011, a Water Risk Index (WRI) of 6.63 (categorized as Medium) combined with low exposure (11.76) but high vulnerability (56.41) and high susceptibility (48.32) resulted in a high overall water risk.  The high lack of coping capabilities (75.21) and lack of adaptive capacities (45.69) indicate a critical need for improvements in both immediate responses and long-term adaptation strategies.  Despite relatively low exposure, Namibia's high vulnerability and susceptibility suggest underlying weaknesses making it highly susceptible to water stress."

However, the high vulnerability score (54.5) highlights significant weaknesses, primarily due to a very high lack of coping capabilities (82.98) and a high lack of adaptive capacities (51.71).  This suggests that despite relatively low exposure to water-related hazards, Syria's existing vulnerabilities significantly increase its overall water risk.\n\n\n**Nepal (2011):** Nepal in 2011 had a medium WRI of 6.15, stemming from low exposure (9.97) but exceptionally high vulnerability (61.69). This high vulnerability is driven by very high susceptibility (50.72), high lack of coping capabilities (81.84), and high lack of adaptive capacities (52.52).  Despite low exposure, Nepal's inherent vulnerabilities create a significant water risk profile.\n\n\n**Venezuela (2011):** Venezuela's water risk in 2011 was moderate (WRI 6.11, Medium category), characterized by medium exposure (13.42), medium vulnerability (45.57), and medium susceptibility (23.82). While exposure was higher than in Syria or Nepal, the lower vulnerability reflects relatively better coping capabilities (74.43) and adaptive capacities (38.46) compared to the other countries. This suggests that while facing moderate exposure, Venezuela's capacity to manage water risks is relatively better.\n\n\n**Gabun (2011):**  In Gabun during 2011, a medium WRI of 6.3 was observed, resulting from low exposure (11.82) but a medium vulnerability score (53.34). This vulnerability is explained by high susceptibility (34.11) and very high lack of coping capabilities (83.2), contrasted with a moderate lack of adaptive capacities (42.7).  Similar to Syria and Nepal, Gabun's high lack of coping capabilities is a major driver of its water risk, despite relatively low exposure.\n\n\n**Bosnien und Herzegowina (2011):** Bosnia and Herzegovina in 2011 exhibited a medium WRI of 6.25, influenced by medium exposure (13.89) but low vulnerability (45.0).  This low vulnerability is a result of low susceptibility (19.66), relatively low lack of coping capabilities (73.14), and moderate lack of adaptive capacities (42.19).  Despite moderate exposure, Bosnia and Herzegovina demonstrates a comparatively lower water risk profile due to its better coping and adaptive capacities."

This suggests that despite considerable challenges in coping and adaptation, other factors mitigated overall vulnerability.\n\n**Mazedonien (2011):** In Mazedonien in 2011, a medium WRI of 5.86 and medium exposure (14.28) contributed to low vulnerability (41.03), characterized by low susceptibility (19.28), moderate lack of coping capabilities (64.74), and notable lack of adaptive capacities (39.05).  Similar to Kuba,  the relatively low vulnerability despite moderate challenges in coping and adaptation is noteworthy.\n\n**Laos (2011):** In Laos in 2011, a low WRI of 5.8 and very low exposure (9.7) unexpectedly led to high vulnerability (59.78), primarily due to high susceptibility (47.38), extremely high lack of coping capabilities (84.77), and considerable lack of adaptive capacities (47.2). This highlights the significant impact of limited coping and adaptive mechanisms on vulnerability, even with low exposure.\n\n**Irak (2011):** In Irak in 2011, a low WRI of 5.77 and very low exposure (9.18) resulted in high vulnerability (62.87), driven by high susceptibility (39.33) and extremely high lack of coping capabilities (89.09) and significant lack of adaptive capacities (60.2).

This vulnerability stemmed from a medium susceptibility (31.04), significantly influenced by high lack of coping (67.72) and medium lack of adaptive capacities (39.31).  In summary, despite a low WRI, South Africa faced considerable vulnerability in 2011 due primarily to deficiencies in coping and adaptive capacities.\n\n\n**Tunesien (Tunisia):**  Tunisia in 2011 showed a low WRI of 5.72 and medium exposure (12.43), leading to a medium vulnerability score (46.04).  However, its susceptibility was low (22.86), contrasting with high lack of coping capabilities (68.97) and high lack of adaptive capacities (46.3).  In summary, Tunisia's medium vulnerability in 2011, despite low susceptibility, was driven by significant limitations in coping and adaptive capacities.\n\n\n**Ungarn (Hungary):**  Hungary in 2011 had a low WRI (5.49) but a high exposure level (15.37), yet its vulnerability was low (35.73). This low vulnerability was due to low susceptibility (16.52), moderate lack of coping capabilities (54.58), and moderate lack of adaptive capacities (36.08).  In summary, despite high exposure, Hungary exhibited low vulnerability in 2011 due to relatively lower susceptibility and moderate deficiencies in coping and adaptive capacities.\n\n\n**Botsuana (Botswana):** In 2011, Botswana displayed a low WRI (5.56) and low exposure (11.52), yet it presented a medium vulnerability (48.26). This was attributed to medium susceptibility (30.25), high lack of coping capabilities (68.14), and high lack of adaptive capacities (46.4).  In summary, Botswana's medium vulnerability in 2011, despite low exposure and WRI, was largely due to considerable shortcomings in coping and adaptive capacities.\n\n\n**Serbien (Serbia):** Serbia in 2011 had a low WRI (5.44) and medium exposure (13.1), resulting in low vulnerability (41.55). This low vulnerability was a consequence of low susceptibility (19.87), high lack of coping capabilities (66.05), and moderate lack of adaptive capacities (38.74).  In summary, Serbia, despite medium exposure, showed low vulnerability in 2011, likely due to low susceptibility, although coping capacities were still a concern."

However, the country exhibited high vulnerability (55.23), driven by high susceptibility (43.45), a significant lack of coping capabilities (80.64), and a moderate lack of adaptive capacities (41.61).  This suggests that while the exposure to water-related risks is low, Bolivia's inherent vulnerabilities and limited capacity to cope with or adapt to such risks pose a significant challenge.\n\n\n**Turkey (2011):** In Turkey in 2011, a low WRI of 5.38 reflected low exposure (11.81) and medium vulnerability (45.57). This vulnerability was characterized by low susceptibility (21.41), moderate lack of coping capabilities (68.14), and moderate lack of adaptive capacities (47.15).  Despite relatively low exposure, Turkey's moderate vulnerability indicates a need for attention to its coping and adaptive capacities to mitigate potential water risks.\n\n\n**Lebanon (2011):** In Lebanon during 2011, a low WRI of 5.01 resulted from low exposure (11.12) and low overall vulnerability (45.03). This low vulnerability stemmed from low susceptibility (21.05), relatively high lack of coping capabilities (70.28), and moderate lack of adaptive capacities (43.75).  Lebanon's low vulnerability despite relatively high lack of coping capabilities suggests that other factors, such as low exposure and susceptibility, are mitigating the overall water risk.\n\n\n**Iran (2011):** In Iran in 2011, the low WRI of 5.11 was influenced by low exposure (10.4) and medium vulnerability (49.07).  This medium vulnerability was a result of low susceptibility (21.48), a high lack of coping capabilities (80.01), and moderate lack of adaptive capacities (45.73). Similar to Bolivia, Iran shows that even with low exposure, high lack of coping capabilities can contribute to a moderate vulnerability level.\n\n\n**Jordan (2011):**  In Jordan in 2011, the low WRI (5.13) was a consequence of low exposure (11.5) and low vulnerability (44.61).  This low vulnerability was composed of medium susceptibility (24.18), moderate lack of coping capabilities (67.33), and moderate lack of adaptive capacities (42.33).  Jordan's relatively low vulnerability suggests that despite moderate challenges in coping and adaptation, the overall water risk remains low due to low exposure and susceptibility."

Summary: Despite moderate deficiencies in coping and adaptive capacities, the Island region showed very low overall vulnerability to water stress in 2011, likely due to low exposure and susceptibility.\n\n\n**Schweden (2011):** In 2011, Sweden (Schweden) showed a very low WRI of 2.0, very low exposure (8.14), and very low vulnerability (24.57), characterized by very low susceptibility (14.34), and moderate lack of coping capabilities (35.46) and adaptive capacities (23.91). Summary: Similar to the Island region, Sweden exhibited low vulnerability to water stress in 2011, indicating a robust water management system despite moderate limitations in coping and adaptive capacities.\n\n\n**Bahrain (2011):** In 2011, Bahrain registered a very low WRI of 1.66 and very low exposure (4.03), but showed low vulnerability (41.27) due to significantly higher lack of coping capabilities (61.07) and adaptive capacities (47.01) compared to Sweden and the Island region, despite maintaining very low susceptibility (15.74). Summary:  Bahrain's low vulnerability score is misleading; while exposure and susceptibility were low, significant weaknesses in coping and adaptive capacities suggest a higher risk of water stress than the overall vulnerability score indicates.\n\n\n**Kiribati (2011):**  In 2011, Kiribati had a very low WRI of 1.88 and very low exposure (3.31), but displayed high vulnerability (56.87) because of extremely high lack of coping capabilities (83.54) and high lack of adaptive capacities (45.56), coupled with high susceptibility (41.52). Summary: Kiribati faced a high vulnerability to water stress in 2011 despite low exposure, primarily due to severe limitations in coping and adaptive mechanisms and high susceptibility.\n\n\n**Finnland (2011):** In 2011, Finland (Finnland) had a very low WRI of 2.06, very low exposure (8.14), and very low vulnerability (25.27),  stemming from very low susceptibility (14.67) and moderate lack of coping capabilities (36.55) and adaptive capacities (24.59). Summary: Similar to Sweden and the Island region, Finland displayed low vulnerability to water stress in 2011, suggesting effective water management strategies despite moderate limitations in coping and adaptive capacities."

This suggests a low overall risk profile for Katar in 2011 related to water resources.\n\n\n**Tonga (2013):** In 2013, Tonga showed very high exposure (55.27) and a very high WRI (28.23), resulting in medium vulnerability (51.07) due to medium susceptibility (27.72), significantly high lack of coping capabilities (80.56), and a notable lack of adaptive capacities (44.94).  This indicates a substantial vulnerability to water-related risks despite the medium vulnerability classification.\n\n\n**Malta (2011):** In 2011, Malta had very low exposure (2.15) and a very low WRI (0.72), leading to very low vulnerability (33.34) characterized by very low susceptibility (15.21), moderate lack of coping capabilities (50.13), and moderate lack of adaptive capacities (34.67).  Malta demonstrates a low risk profile in 2011, despite having slightly higher coping and adaptive capacity limitations than Katar.\n\n\n**Saudi-Arabien (2011):** In 2011, Saudi Arabia displayed very low exposure (2.91) and a very low WRI (1.26), resulting in low vulnerability (43.3) attributed to low susceptibility (18.26), a high lack of coping capabilities (67.84), and a high lack of adaptive capacities (43.8).

This suggests that despite relatively lower exposure compared to other regions, the Solomon Islands' high vulnerability is primarily due to limited adaptive and coping mechanisms.\n\n**Costa Rica (2013):** In 2013, Costa Rica (Region: Costa Rica) had a very high WRI (16.94) and exposure (42.61), yet demonstrated low vulnerability (39.75) due to low susceptibility (21.58), despite a moderate lack of coping capabilities (64.1) and a low lack of adaptive capacities (33.58).  This indicates that despite high exposure, effective adaptive and coping strategies contribute significantly to lower vulnerability in Costa Rica compared to other regions.\n\n**Bangladesch (2013):** In 2013, Bangladesh (Region: Bangladesch) showed a very high WRI (19.81) and exposure (31.7), leading to high vulnerability (62.5) characterized by high susceptibility (40.92), a substantial lack of coping capabilities (86.23), and a high lack of adaptive capacities (60.34). This suggests that Bangladesh's high vulnerability stems from both high exposure and significant deficiencies in coping and adaptive capacities, similar to the Solomon Islands.\n\n**Philippinen (2013):** The Philippines (Region: Philippinen) in 2013 displayed a very high WRI (27.52) and exposure (52.46), resulting in a medium vulnerability (52.46) despite high susceptibility (33.74), high lack of coping capabilities (80.47), and moderate lack of adaptive capacities (43.16).  This suggests that while exposure and lack of coping capabilities are high, other factors contribute to a comparatively lower vulnerability than other regions with similar susceptibility.\n\n**Guatemala (2013):**  Guatemala (Region: Guatemala) in 2013 had a very high WRI (20.88) and exposure (36.3), leading to high vulnerability (57.53) due to high susceptibility (38.57), high lack of coping capabilities (80.8), and moderate lack of adaptive capacities (53.21).

This indicates a high level of risk related to water resources in the region.\n\n\n**El Salvador (2013):**  El Salvador in 2013 experienced very high exposure to water risks (32.6), leading to a very high WRI (16.85), although its vulnerability (51.69) was categorized as medium due to medium susceptibility (29.5), high lack of coping capabilities (75.69), and moderate lack of adaptive capacities (49.88). This suggests that despite high exposure,  adaptive capacity plays a role in mitigating the overall water risk.\n\n\n**Brunei Darussalam (2013):**  Brunei Darussalam in 2013 had very high exposure (41.1) to water-related hazards, yet exhibited a very high WRI (15.8) that is surprisingly low considering its exposure. This is due to low vulnerability (38.44) resulting from very low susceptibility (14.48), despite a moderate lack of coping capabilities (64.69) and lack of adaptive capacities (36.15).  This suggests that other factors, not captured in this data, might be contributing to a lower overall water risk.\n\n\n**Timor-Leste (2013):** In Timor-Leste during 2013, very high exposure to water risks (25.73) coupled with very high vulnerability (63.61), stemming from very high susceptibility (52.16), high lack of coping capabilities (79.36), and lack of adaptive capacities (59.31), resulted in a very high WRI (16.37).

This suggests that while Fiji faces significant exposure to environmental hazards, its vulnerability is moderated by moderate susceptibility and adaptive capacity, although coping capabilities are a concern.\n\n\n**Guinea-Bissau (2013):** In Guinea-Bissau in 2013, very high exposure (19.65) and a very high WRI (13.09) led to extremely high vulnerability (66.58), stemming from very high susceptibility (53.39), extremely high lack of coping capabilities (87.99), and high lack of adaptive capacities (58.36). This indicates a critical situation with high exposure and extremely weak adaptive capacity contributing to very high overall vulnerability.\n\n\n**Nicaragua (2013):** In Nicaragua in 2013, very high exposure (27.23) and a very high WRI (14.89) produced a high vulnerability score (54.69), characterized by high susceptibility (37.09), very high lack of coping capabilities (81.32), and medium lack of adaptive capacities (45.65).  Nicaragua shows a high vulnerability despite similar exposure to Fiji, highlighting the importance of coping and adaptive capacities in determining overall risk.\n\n\n**Japan (2013):** In Japan in 2013, despite very high exposure (45.91) and a very high WRI (14.1), vulnerability was very low (30.71) due to low susceptibility (16.84), low lack of coping capabilities (40.08), and low lack of adaptive capacities (35.22).

This suggests that despite high exposure, Vietnam's vulnerability is largely driven by limited adaptive and coping capacities.\n\n**Chile (2013):** In Chile in 2013, a very high exposure to water risk (30.95, Very High category) resulted in a very high Water Risk Index (WRI) of 12.28 (Very High category), yet low vulnerability (39.66, Low category) due to low susceptibility (20.71, Low category), relatively lower lack of coping capabilities (58.65), and a similar lack of adaptive capacities (39.63). This indicates that despite high exposure, Chile possesses relatively strong adaptive and coping mechanisms.\n\n\n**Jamaica (2013):** Jamaica in 2013 exhibited a very high Water Risk Index (WRI) of 12.15 (Very High category) due to very high exposure (25.82, Very High category) and medium vulnerability (47.07, Medium category). This medium vulnerability stemmed from medium susceptibility (27.1, Medium category), high lack of coping capabilities (72.09), and moderate lack of adaptive capacities (42.01).  Similar to Vietnam, Jamaica's vulnerability is primarily due to limitations in coping and adaptive capacities, despite high exposure.\n\n**Haiti (2013):** Haiti in 2013 faced a very high Water Risk Index (WRI) of 11.88 (Very High category) stemming from high exposure (16.26, High category) and extremely high vulnerability (73.05, Very High category). This extremely high vulnerability was characterized by very high susceptibility (61.64, Very High category), extremely high lack of coping capabilities (89.63), and high lack of adaptive capacities (67.88).
