Note that the data is not in CSV format; it's presented as a series of entries, each with multiple key-value pairs.  I'll treat each entry as a \"row\" for the purpose of this analysis.\n\n\n**Row 1 (CID: 135411085):**  Compound 135411085, with SMILES string CCC(SC1=NC(C2=CC=CC(OC)=C2)=C(C#N)C(=O)N1)C(=O)NC1=CC=CC(=C1)C(C)=O, has a molecular formula of C24H22N4O4S and a molecular weight of 462.5.  This molecule, identified as N-(3-acetylphenyl)-2-[[5-cyano-4-(3-methoxyphenyl)-6-oxo-1H-pyrimidin-2-yl]sulfanyl]butanamide, exhibits a calculated XLogP of 3.3, a TPSA of 146.0, and a pIC50 of -1.778, suggesting moderate hydrophobicity and relatively weak activity.  The complexity score of 890 indicates a structurally complex molecule.\n\n**Row 2 (CID: 2811874):** Compound 2811874, characterized by the SMILES string CC(C)C1=CC=C(NC(=O)CSC2=NC(=CC=N2)C2=CC=CS2)C=C1, possesses a molecular formula C19H19N3OS2 and molecular weight 369.5.  This molecule, named N-(4-propan-2-ylphenyl)-2-(4-thiophen-2-ylpyrimidin-2-yl)sulfanylacetamide, shows a higher XLogP of 4.5, indicating greater hydrophobicity compared to the previous compound. Its TPSA is 108.0 and pIC50 is -1.602, suggesting relatively weak activity. The complexity score is 427.\n\n**Row 3 (CID: 135408428):** Compound 135408428, represented by the SMILES string CC1=CC(=O)NC(SCC(=O)NC2=C(OC3=CC=CC=C3)C=CC(Cl)=C2)=N1, has a molecular formula C19H16ClN3O3S and a molecular weight of 401.9.  Identified as N-(5-chloro-2-phenoxyphenyl)-2-[(4-methyl-6-oxo-1H-pyrimidin-2-yl)sulfanyl]acetamide, it has an XLogP of 3.7, a TPSA of 105.0 and a pIC50 of -2,  indicating moderate hydrophobicity and weak activity.  Its complexity score is 619.\n\n**Row 4 (CID: 135410958):** Compound 135410958, with SMILES COC1=C(OC)C=C(NC(=O)CSC2=NC(O)=CC(=N2)C2=CC=CC=C2)C=C1, has a molecular formula C20H19N3O4S and molecular weight 397.4.  The IUPAC name is N-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-2-[(6-oxo-4-phenyl-1H-pyrimidin-2-yl)sulfanyl]acetamide.  This compound demonstrates an XLogP of 2.7, a TPSA of 114.0, and a pIC50 of -1.653, suggesting lower hydrophobicity and weak activity.  The complexity score is 631.\n\n**Row 5 (CID: 135411084):** Compound 135411084, having the SMILES string COC1=CC=CC(=C1)C1=C(C#N)C(=O)NC(SCC(=O)NC2=CC=C(C=C2)C(C)=O)=N1, has a molecular formula C22H18N4O4S and a molecular weight of 434.5.  Named N-(4-acetylphenyl)-2-[[5-cyano-4-(3-methoxyphenyl)-6-oxo-1H-pyrimidin-2-yl]sulfanyl]acetamide, it displays an XLogP of 2.3, a TPSA of 146.0, and a pIC50 of -1.778, suggesting relatively low hydrophobicity and weak activity. Its complexity score is 836.\n\n\n**Summary:** The five compounds share structural similarities, all containing amide and pyrimidine moieties, and thioether linkages.  They exhibit varying degrees of hydrophobicity (XLogP) and all show weak activity (low pIC50 values).  The complexity scores suggest a range of structural intricacy.  Further analysis would be needed to determine the relationship between structure, hydrophobicity, and activity."
