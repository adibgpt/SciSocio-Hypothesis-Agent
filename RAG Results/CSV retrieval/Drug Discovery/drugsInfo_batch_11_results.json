Bone resorption by osteoclasts causes local acidification, releasing the bisphosphonate, which is taken into the osteoclast by fluid-phase endocytosis.Endocytic vesicles become acidified, releasing bisphosphonates into the cytosol of osteoclasts where they act.Osteoclasts mediate resorption of bone.When osteoclasts bind to bone they form podosomes, ring structures of F-actin.Disruption of the podosomes causes osteoclasts to detach from bones, preventing bone resorption.,TargetActionsOrganism: Pamidronic acid inhibits enzymes related to bone resorption and induces apoptosis in certain cells., DrugConditions: [], DrugCategories: ['Agents Causing Muscle Toxicity', 'Antineoplastic Agents', etc.].\n\n2. **Seamless Sentence:** Pamidronic acid (DB00282), a bisphosphonate used to treat Paget's disease, hypercalcemia of malignancy, and osteolytic bone lesions, targets proteins ['P14324', 'O95749', 'P42574', 'P55211'] by inhibiting osteoclast-mediated bone loss through binding to hydroxyapatite, acidification, and disruption of podosomes, preventing bone resorption; it's categorized under ['Agents Causing Muscle Toxicity', 'Antineoplastic Agents', etc.].\n\n3. **Summary:** Pamidronic acid (DB00282) is a bisphosphonate that effectively inhibits bone resorption by targeting osteoclasts, making it useful in treating various bone diseases.\n\n\n**DrugID: DB00358**\n\n1. **Column Names and Values:** DrugID: DB00358, DrugName: Mefloquine, DrugDescription: Mefloquine is an antimalarial agent used in the prophylaxis and treatment of malaria caused by Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium vivax., DrugTarget: ['P29274'], DrugPharmacodynamics: Mefloquine is an antimalarial drug acting as a blood schizonticide, preventing and treating malaria., DrugSmile: OC(C1CCCCN1)C1=CC(=NC2=C1C=CC=C2C(F)(F)F)C(F)(F)F, DrugMechanism: The mechanism of action of mefloquine is not completely understood.

It is believed that copper is reduced to the Cu+ form prior to transport. Once inside the enterocyte, it is bound to copper transport protein ATOX which shuttles the ion to copper transporting ATPase- on the golgi membrane which take up copper into the golgi apparatus. Once copper has been secreted by enterocytes into the systemic circulation it remain largely bound by ceruloplasmin (-%), albumin (%), and alpha -macroglobulin (%).Copper is an essential element in the body and is incorporated into many oxidase enzymes as a cofactor. It is also a component of zinc/copper super oxide dismutase, giving it an anti-oxidant role.,TargetActionsOrganism:  Copper acts as a cofactor for many enzymes in various organisms., DrugConditions: ['Emergency Contraception', 'IUD therapy', 'Trace Element Deficiency', 'Dietary supplementation'], DrugCategories: ['Copper-containing Intrauterine Device', 'Decreased Embryonic Implantation', etc.].\n\n2. **Seamless Sentence:** Copper (DB09130), a transition metal found in supplements and TPN solutions, interacts with a large number of proteins (a very extensive list is provided), acting as an essential cofactor for many enzymes and possessing antioxidant properties via zinc/copper superoxide dismutase; it's absorbed through various pathways, binds to transport proteins, and its ions reduce fertility in copper IUDs, categorized under ['Copper-containing Intrauterine Device', 'Decreased Embryonic Implantation', etc.], used in ['Emergency Contraception', 'IUD therapy', etc.].\n\n3. **Summary:** Copper (DB09130) is an essential trace element acting as a cofactor in numerous enzymes, with additional roles in antioxidant defense and contraception via IUDs.
