        "response": "Row 73 describes the drug Avonex (Interferon beta-1a), with RxNorm CUI 75917, indicated for multiple sclerosis (including relapsing-remitting, secondary progressive, and primary progressive forms), corresponding to MONDO IDs MONDO:0005301, MONDO:0005314, MONDO:0000450, MONDO:0000451 and UMLS CUI's C0026769, C0751967, C0751965, C0751964.  This indicates that Avonex is used to treat various forms of multiple sclerosis.\n\nRow 74 details the drug Lynparza (Olaparib), RxNorm CUI 1597582, indicated for ovarian, prostate, and breast cancers, and generally malignant neoplasms,  represented by MONDO IDs MONDO:0008170, MONDO:0008315, MONDO:0007254, MONDO:0004992 and UMLS CUIs C1140680, C0376358, C0006142, C0006826.  This shows Lynparza's application in treating several types of cancer.\n\nRow 70 shows the drug Cefotaxime (Cefotaxime sodium, Claforan), with RxNorm CUI 2186, but lacks specified indications, MONDO IDs, and UMLS CUIs.  Therefore, no indications are provided for this drug in this dataset.\n\nRow 72 describes the drug Avandia (Rosiglitazone), RxNorm CUI 84108, indicated for diabetes mellitus, specifically type 2, represented by MONDO ID MONDO:0015122 (listed twice) and UMLS CUIs C0011849 and C0011860.  This highlights Avandia's use in treating type 2 diabetes.\n\nRow 71 shows the drug Cefotetan, with RxNorm CUI 2187,  but similarly to row 70, lacks specified indications, MONDO IDs, and UMLS CUIs; thus, no indications are listed for this drug in this dataset."
