Note that \"DrugConditions\" is empty for all entries in the provided data.\n\n**DrugID: DB00996**\n\n1. **Column Names and Values:** DrugID: DB00996, DrugName: Gabapentin, DrugDescription: Gabapentin is an anticonvulsant medication used in the management of peripheral neuropathic pains, postherpetic neuralgia, and partial-onset seizures., DrugTarget: ['P54289', 'Q9NY47', 'A0A024R8I1', 'Q00975', 'P30542', 'O43525', 'Q9NR82'], DrugPharmacodynamics: Gabapentin is an anti-convulsant medication that inhibits the release of excitatory neurotransmitters, allowing for its use against pathologic neurotransmission such as that seen in neuropathic pain and seizure disorders. It has a wide therapeutic index, with doses in excess of 8000 mg/kg failing to cause a fatal reaction in rats. Gabapentin is ineffective in absence seizures and should be used in caution in patients with mixed seizure disorders involving absence seizures. Gabapentin has been associated with drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS), otherwise known as multi-organ hypersensitivity. This reaction can prove fatal and early symptoms such as fever, lymphadenopathy, and rash should be promptly investigated., DrugSmile: NCC1(CC(O)=O)CCCCC1, DrugMechanism: The precise mechanism through which gabapentin exerts its therapeutic effects is unclear. The primary mode of action appears to be at the auxillary \u03b1\u03b4- subunit of voltage-gated calcium channels (though a low affinity for the \u03b1\u03b4- subunit has also been reported). The major function of these subunits is to facilitate the movement of pore-forming \u03b1 subunits of calcium channels from the endoplasmic reticulum to the cell membrane of pre-synaptic neurons. There is evidence that chronic pain states can cause an increase in the expression of \u03b1\u03b4 subunits and that these changes correlate with hyperalgesia. Gabapentin appears to inhibit the action of \u03b1\u03b4- subunits, thus decreasing the density of pre-synaptic voltage-gated calcium channels and subsequent release of excitatory neurotransmitters. It is likely that this inhibition is also responsible for the anti-epileptic action of gabapentin. There is some evidence that gabapentin also acts on adenosine receptors, and voltage-gated potassium channels, though the clinical relevance of its action at these sites is unclear., DrugConditions: [], DrugCategories: ['Acids, Acyclic', 'Acids, Carbocyclic', 'Amines', 'Amino Acids', 'Amino Acids, Peptides, and Proteins', 'Aminobutyrates', 'Analgesics', 'Anti-epileptic Agent', 'Anticonvulsants', 'Butyrates', 'Central Nervous System Agents', 'Central Nervous System Depressants', 'Cyclohexanecarboxylic Acids', 'Cyclohexanes', 'Cycloparaffins', 'Decreased Central Nervous System Disorganized Electrical Activity', 'Drugs causing inadvertant photosensitivity', 'Gabapentin and Prodrugs', 'Gabapentinoids', 'Miscellaneous Anticonvulsants', 'Nervous System', 'Neurotransmitter Agents', 'Peripheral Nervous System Agents', 'Photosensitizing Agents', 'Psychotropic Drugs', 'Sensory System Agents', 'Tranquilizing Agents']\n\n2. **Seamless Sentence:** Gabapentin (DB00996), an anticonvulsant used for neuropathic pain, postherpetic neuralgia, and seizures, targets several proteins (['P54289', 'Q9NY47', etc.]) and primarily acts by inhibiting excitatory neurotransmitter release via voltage-gated calcium channels, although its mechanism isn't fully understood, and it also shows activity at adenosine and potassium channels; its wide therapeutic index is notable, but it carries a risk of DRESS syndrome, and it's categorized under various pharmacological classes including analgesics, anticonvulsants, and central nervous system agents.\n\n3. **Summary Statement:** Gabapentin is a broadly used anticonvulsant with a complex mechanism of action, primarily targeting voltage-gated calcium channels, but also potentially other receptors.  While generally safe with a wide therapeutic index, it has a serious side effect profile including the potentially fatal DRESS syndrome.\n\n\n**DrugID: DB01083**\n\n1. **Column Names and Values:** DrugID: DB01083, DrugName: Orlistat, DrugDescription: Orlistat is a reversible inhibitor of gastrointestinal lipases indicated for weight loss and weight maintenance., DrugTarget: ['P16233', 'P07098', 'P49327'], DrugPharmacodynamics: Orlistat helps with weight reduction and maintenance by inhibiting the absorption of dietary fats via the inhibition of lipase enzymes., DrugSmile: CCCCCCCCCCC[C@@H](C[C@@H]1OC(=O)[C@H]1CCCCCC)OC(=O)[C@H](CC(C)C)NC=O, DrugMechanism: Orlistat is a potent and selective inhibitor of various lipase enzymes responsible for the metabolism of fat. It acts in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract via covalent binding to the serine residues located on the active site of both gastric and pancreatic lipase. When orlistat is taken with food containing fat, it partially inhibits the hydrolysis of triglycerides. This decreases absorption of monoaclglycerides and free fatty acids, contributing to weight maintenance and weight loss., DrugConditions: ['Weight Reduction'], DrugCategories: ['Alimentary Tract and Metabolism', 'Anti-Obesity Agents', 'Antiobesity Preparations, Excl. Diet Products', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A Inducers', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A4 Inducers', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A4 Inducers (strength unknown)', 'Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme Inducers', 'Enzyme Inhibitors', 'Intestinal Lipase Inhibitor', 'Lactones', 'Lipase Inhibitors', 'Lipid Regulating Agents', 'Miscellaneous GI Drugs', 'Peripherally Acting Antiobesity Products']\n\n2. **Seamless Sentence:** Orlistat (DB01083), indicated for weight loss, inhibits gastrointestinal lipases (targets: ['P16233', 'P07098', 'P49327']), thus reducing fat absorption by covalently binding to serine residues in their active sites, leading to decreased triglyceride hydrolysis and reduced absorption of monoacylglycerides and free fatty acids, and it's classified within categories related to alimentary tract metabolism, anti-obesity agents, and lipase inhibitors.\n\n3. **Summary Statement:** Orlistat is a direct and effective inhibitor of gastrointestinal lipases, leading to reduced fat absorption and weight loss. Its mechanism of action is well understood, involving covalent binding to the active site of the enzyme.\n\n\n**DrugID: DB00759**\n\n1. **Column Names and Values:** DrugID: DB00759, DrugName: Tetracycline, DrugDescription: Tetracycline is an antibiotic used to treat a wide variety of susceptible infections., DrugTarget: ['P02359', 'P0AG59', 'P0A7V3', 'P0A7W7', 'P0A7U3', 'P04156', 'C9EH48', 'Q9UM07'], DrugPharmacodynamics: Tetracycline is a short-acting antibiotic that inhibits bacterial growth by inhibiting translation. It binds to the 30S ribosomal subunit and prevents the amino-acyl tRNA from binding to the A site of the ribosome. It also binds to some extent to the 50S ribosomal subunit. This binding is reversible in nature. Additionally tetracycline may alter the cytoplasmic membrane of bacteria causing leakage of intracellular contents, such as nucleotides, from the cell., DrugSmile: [H][C@@]12C[C@@]3([H])C(=C(O)[C@]1(O)C(=O)C(C(N)=O)=C(O)[C@H]2N(C)C)C(=O)C1=C(O)C=CC=C1[C@@]3(C)O, DrugMechanism: Tetracycline passively diffuses through porin channels in the bacterial membrane and reversibly binds to the S ribosomal subunit, preventing binding of tRNA to the mRNA-ribosome complex, and thus interfering with protein synthesis., DrugConditions: [], DrugCategories: ['Agents that produce neuromuscular block (indirect)', 'Alimentary Tract and Metabolism', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents', 'Anti-Infective Agents', 'Antibacterials for Systemic Use', 'Antibiotics for Topical Use', 'Antiinfectives and Antiseptics for Local Oral Treatment', 'Antiinfectives for Systemic Use', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A Inhibitors', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A Substrates', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A4 Inhibitors', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A4 Inhibitors (strength unknown)', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A4 Substrates', 'Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme Inhibitors', 'Cytochrome P-450 Substrates', 'Dermatologicals', 'Drugs causing inadvertant photosensitivity', 'Drugs for Acid Related Disorders', 'Drugs for Peptic Ulcer and Gastro-Oesophageal Reflux Disease (Gord)', 'Drugs that are Mainly Renally Excreted', 'Enzyme Inhibitors', 'Naphthacenes', 'OAT1/SLC22A6 inhibitors', 'OAT3/SLC22A8 Inhibitors', 'OAT3/SLC22A8 Substrates', 'Ophthalmological and Otological Preparations', 'Ophthalmologicals', 'Organic Anion Transporting Polypeptide 2B1 Inhibitors', 'Otologicals', 'Photosensitizing Agents', 'Protein Synthesis Inhibitors', 'Sensory Organs', 'Stomatological Preparations', 'Tetracyclines']\n\n2. **Seamless Sentence:** Tetracycline (DB00759), a broad-spectrum antibiotic targeting various bacterial proteins (['P02359', 'P0AG59', etc.]), inhibits bacterial protein synthesis by reversibly binding to the 30S ribosomal subunit, preventing tRNA binding and potentially disrupting the cytoplasmic membrane;  its mechanism involves passive diffusion across the bacterial membrane and is classified under numerous categories including anti-bacterial agents, protein synthesis inhibitors, and various cytochrome P450 related classes.\n\n3. **Summary Statement:** Tetracycline's mechanism of action is well-characterized, involving ribosomal binding and inhibition of protein synthesis. Its broad-spectrum activity and various other effects make it a versatile antibiotic, although it falls under many categories due to its diverse effects.\n\n\n**DrugID: DB00740**\n\n1. **Column Names and Values:** DrugID: DB00740, DrugName: Riluzole, DrugDescription: Riluzole is a glutamate antagonist used to treat amyotrophic lateral sclerosis., DrugTarget: ['Q14524', 'Q9UPY5'], DrugPharmacodynamics: Riluzole, a member of the benzothiazole class, is indicated for the treatment of patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Riluzole extends survival and/or time to tracheostomy. It is also neuroprotective in various in vivo experimental models of neuronal injury involving excitotoxic mechanisms. The etiology and pathogenesis of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) are not known, although a number of hypotheses have been advanced. One hypothesis is that motor neurons, made vulnerable through either genetic predisposition or environmental factors, are injured by glutamate. In some cases of familial ALS the enzyme superoxide dismutase has been found to be defective., DrugSmile: NC1=NC2=C(S1)C=C(OC(F)(F)F)C=C2, DrugMechanism: The mode of action of riluzole is unknown. Its pharmacological properties include the following, some of which may be related to its effect: ) an inhibitory effect on glutamate release (activation of glutamate reuptake), ) inactivation of voltage-dependent sodium channels, and ) ability to interfere with intracellular events that follow transmitter binding at excitatory amino acid receptors., DrugConditions: [], DrugCategories: ['Anticonvulsants', 'BCRP/ABCG2 Substrates', 'Benzothiazoles', 'Central Nervous System Agents', 'Central Nervous System Depressants', 'Compounds used in a research, industrial, or household setting', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP1A2 Substrates', 'Cytochrome P-450 Substrates', 'Excitatory Amino Acid Agents', 'Excitatory Amino Acid Antagonists', 'Heterocyclic Compounds, Fused-Ring', 'Miscellaneous Central Nervous System Agents', 'Nervous System', 'Neuroprotective Agents', 'Neurotransmitter Agents', 'Protective Agents', 'Sulfur Compounds', 'Thiazoles']\n\n2. **Seamless Sentence:** Riluzole (DB00740), a benzothiazole used in ALS treatment, targets proteins ['Q14524', 'Q9UPY5'] and may act through mechanisms including glutamate release inhibition, sodium channel inactivation, and interference with intracellular events following excitatory amino acid receptor binding, although its precise mechanism remains unclear; it shows neuroprotective effects and is categorized as a central nervous system agent and glutamate antagonist.\n\n3. **Summary Statement:** Riluzole's mechanism of action in ALS is not fully elucidated, but it appears to modulate glutamate activity and sodium channels, providing neuroprotective effects.  Further research is needed to fully understand its precise mechanism.\n\n\n**DrugID: DB14509**\n\n1. **Column Names and Values:** DrugID: DB14509, DrugName: Lithium carbonate, DrugDescription: Lithium carbonate is a medication used to treat manic episodes of bipolar disorder., DrugTarget: ['O14732', 'P29218', 'P49841', 'P42263'], DrugPharmacodynamics: Lithium's mechanism of action is still unknown. Lithium's therapeutic action may be due to a number of effects, ranging from inhibition of enzymes such as glycogen synthase kinase 3, inositol phosphatases, or modulation of glutamate receptors., DrugSmile: [Li+].[Li+].[O-]C([O-])=O, DrugMechanism: Lithium's mechanism of action is still unknown. However, the \u201cinositol depletion theory\u201d suggests main potential targets. These targets are inositol monophosphatase, inositol polyphosphatase, and glycogen synthase kinase (GSK-),.The \u201cInositol depletion theory\u201d suggests lithium behaves as an uncompetitive inhibitor of inositol monophosphatase in a manner inversely proportional to the degree of stimulus. This inhibition lowers levels of inositol triphosphate. However, stronger inhibitors of inositol monophosphatase are not as clinically effective and low levels of inositol triphosphate are associated with memory impairment,.Lithium acts on inositol polyphosphatase as an uncompetitive inhibitor. This inhibition is thought to have multiple downstream effects that have yet to be clarified.Lithium regulates phosphorylation of GSK- which regulates other enzymes through phosphorylation. Lithium can also inhibit GSK- through interfering with the magnesium ion in the active site., DrugConditions: [], DrugCategories: ['Acids', 'Acids, Noncarboxylic', 'Alkalies', 'Anions', 'Antidepressive Agents', 'Antimanic Agents', 'Carbon Compounds, Inorganic', 'Carbonates', 'Carbonic Acid', 'Central Nervous System Agents', 'Central Nervous System Depressants', 'Drugs that are Mainly Renally Excreted', 'Drugs that are Mainly Renally Excreted with a Narrow Therapeutic Index', 'Electrolytes', 'Enzyme Inhibitors', 'Ions', 'Lithium Compounds', 'Mood Stabilizer', 'Narrow Therapeutic Index Drugs', 'Nephrotoxic agents', 'Nervous System', 'Neurotoxic agents', 'Psycholeptics', 'Psychotropic Drugs', 'QTc Prolonging Agents', 'Serotonergic Drugs Shown to Increase Risk of Serotonin Syndrome', 'Serotonin Agents', 'Serotonin Modulators', 'Tranquilizing Agents']\n\n2. **Seamless Sentence:** Lithium carbonate (DB14509), used to treat bipolar mania, targets proteins (['O14732', 'P29218', etc.]) and its mechanism, while unclear, may involve the inhibition of enzymes like inositol monophosphatase and glycogen synthase kinase, potentially impacting inositol triphosphate levels; although the exact mechanism is still under investigation, it's classified as an antimanic agent, mood stabilizer, and falls under several categories related to central nervous system effects and electrolyte balance.\n\n3. **Summary Statement:** Lithium carbonate's mechanism of action in treating bipolar disorder remains incompletely understood, but likely involves modulation of several enzymes and signaling pathways.  Its classification across multiple categories reflects its diverse effects on the body."
