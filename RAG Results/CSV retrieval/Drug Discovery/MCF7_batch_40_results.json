Its physicochemical properties, including a low calculated logP and PSA of 65.72, suggest certain characteristics.  \n\n* **Summary:** Fluorouracil demonstrates activity against breast cancer cells via RNA inhibition, exhibiting a moderate IC50 value.\n\n\n**Row 2:**\n\n* **Column Names and Values:** molregno: 78759, iupac_name: DOXORUBICIN, canonical_smiles: COc1cccc2c1C(=O)c1c(O)c3c(c(O)c1C2=O)C[C@@](O)(C(=O)CO)C[C@@H]3O[C@H]1C[C@H](N)[C@H](O)[C@H](C)O1, molecular_weight: 543.53, alogp: 0.00, hba: 12, hbd: 6, psa: 206.07, rtb: 5, ro3_pass: N, num_ro5_violations: 3, cx_logp: 0.53, cx_logd: 0.10, molecular_species: BASE, qed_weighted: 0.24, np_likeness_score: 1.81, ic50_value: 2290, ic50_units: nM, standard_relation: =, target_name: MCF7, target_type: CELL-LINE, cell_description: MCF7 (Breast carcinoma cells), disease_name: Mesothelioma, disease_category: malignant pleural mesothelioma, mechanism_of_action: NULL, action_type: NULL, warning_type: NULL, warning_description: NULL\n\n* **Sentence Description:** Doxorubicin (molregno 78759), a basic molecule with a significantly higher molecular weight (543.53) and IC50 of 2290 nM against MCF7 breast carcinoma cells, is associated with malignant pleural mesothelioma; however, its mechanism of action is not specified. Its properties, including high HBA, HBD, and PSA, and multiple Lipinski rule violations, suggest different drug-like characteristics than fluorouracil.\n\n* **Summary:** Doxorubicin shows activity against breast cancer cells, but in the context of mesothelioma, with a higher molecular weight and a less clear mechanism compared to fluorouracil.\n\n\n**Row 3:**\n\n* **Column Names and Values:** molregno: 78759, iupac_name: DOXORUBICIN, canonical_smiles: COc1cccc2c1C(=O)c1c(O)c3c(c(O)c1C2=O)C[C@@](O)(C(=O)CO)C[C@@H]3O[C@H]1C[C@H](N)[C@H](O)[C@H](C)O1, molecular_weight: 543.53, alogp: 0.00, hba: 12, hbd: 6, psa: 206.07, rtb: 5, ro3_pass: N, num_ro5_violations: 3, cx_logp: 0.53, cx_logd: 0.10, molecular_species: BASE, qed_weighted: 0.24, np_likeness_score: 1.81, ic50_value: 92, ic50_units: nM, standard_relation: =, target_name: MCF7, target_type: CELL-LINE, cell_description: MCF7 (Breast carcinoma cells), disease_name: Thyroid Neoplasms, disease_category: thyroid cancer, mechanism_of_action: NULL, action_type: NULL, warning_type: NULL, warning_description: NULL\n\n* **Sentence Description:**  This row shows Doxorubicin (molregno 78759) again, exhibiting a much lower IC50 of 92 nM against the same MCF7 cells but in the context of thyroid cancer, for which the mechanism of action is also unspecified.  Its physicochemical properties remain consistent with the previous entry.\n\n* **Summary:** Doxorubicin shows significantly higher potency against MCF7 cells in the context of thyroid cancer compared to mesothelioma.\n\n\n**Row 4:**\n\n* **Column Names and Values:** molregno: 368538, iupac_name: FLUOROURACIL, canonical_smiles: O=c1[nH]cc(F)c(=O)[nH]1, molecular_weight: 130.08, alogp: -0.80, hba: 2, hbd: 2, psa: 65.72, rtb: 0, ro3_pass: N, num_ro5_violations: 0, cx_logp: -0.66, cx_logd: -1.08, molecular_species: NEUTRAL, qed_weighted: 0.48, np_likeness_score: -0.80, ic50_value: 25440, ic50_units: nM, standard_relation: =, target_name: MCF7, target_type: CELL-LINE, cell_description: MCF7 (Breast carcinoma cells), disease_name: Neoplasms, disease_category: cancer, mechanism_of_action: DNA inhibitor, action_type: INHIBITOR, warning_type: NULL, warning_description: NULL\n\n* **Sentence Description:** This entry details Fluorouracil (molregno 368538) again, but this time specifying that it inhibits DNA with a significantly higher IC50 value of 25440 nM against MCF7 breast carcinoma cells in the context of neoplasms (cancer). Its physicochemical properties are the same as in the first row.\n\n* **Summary:**  Fluorouracil also acts as a DNA inhibitor against breast cancer cells, but with a much higher IC50 than its RNA inhibitory activity.\n\n\n**Row 5:**\n\n* **Column Names and Values:** molregno: 78759, iupac_name: DOXORUBICIN, canonical_smiles: COc1cccc2c1C(=O)c1c(O)c3c(c(O)c1C2=O)C[C@@](O)(C(=O)CO)C[C@@H]3O[C@H]1C[C@H](N)[C@H](O)[C@H](C)O1, molecular_weight: 543.53, alogp: 0.00, hba: 12, hbd: 6, psa: 206.07, rtb: 5, ro3_pass: N, num_ro5_violations: 3, cx_logp: 0.53, cx_logd: 0.10, molecular_species: BASE, qed_weighted: 0.24, np_likeness_score: 1.81, ic50_value: 1400, ic50_units: nM, standard_relation: =, target_name: MCF7, target_type: CELL-LINE, cell_description: MCF7 (Breast carcinoma cells), disease_name: Neuroendocrine Tumors, disease_category: neuroendocrine neoplasm, mechanism_of_action: NULL, action_type: NULL, warning_type: NULL, warning_description: NULL\n\n* **Sentence Description:** Finally, this row shows Doxorubicin (molregno 78759) with an IC50 of 1400 nM against MCF7 cells within the context of neuroendocrine tumors, and its mechanism of action remains unspecified.
