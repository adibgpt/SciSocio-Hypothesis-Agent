        "response": "Here's an analysis of the provided data, formatted as requested:\n\n**Row 1:**\n\n1. **Column Names and Values:** DiseaseID: MESH:D001835, DiseaseName: Body Weight, DiseaseDescription: The mass or quantity of heaviness of an individual. It is expressed by units of pounds or kilograms., SlimMapping: ['Signs and symptoms'], PathwayNames: Vesicle-mediated transport\n\n2.  The data entry MESH:D001835 identifies Body Weight, defined as the mass or quantity of heaviness of an individual measured in pounds or kilograms,  as a condition categorized under 'Signs and symptoms' and linked to the Vesicle-mediated transport pathway.\n\n3. Summary: This row describes Body Weight as a measurable physiological characteristic rather than a disease in the traditional sense,  its association with vesicle-mediated transport suggesting a potential link to cellular processes influencing weight regulation.\n\n\n**Row 2:**\n\n1. **Column Names and Values:** DiseaseID: MESH:D001848, DiseaseName: Bone Diseases, Developmental, DiseaseDescription: Diseases resulting in abnormal GROWTH or abnormal MORPHOGENESIS of BONES., SlimMapping: ['Musculoskeletal disease'], PathwayNames: ZBP1(DAI) mediated induction of type I IFNs\n\n2.  MESH:D001848 classifies Developmental Bone Diseases, characterized by abnormal bone growth or morphogenesis, as a Musculoskeletal disease associated with the ZBP1(DAI) mediated induction of type I IFNs pathway.\n\n3. Summary: This row details a category of bone diseases stemming from developmental abnormalities, highlighting a potential immunological connection through the interferon pathway.\n\n\n**Row 3:**\n\n1. **Column Names and Values:** DiseaseID: MESH:D001849, DiseaseName: Bone Diseases, Endocrine, DiseaseDescription: Diseases of the bones related to hyperfunction or hypofunction of the endocrine glands., SlimMapping: ['Endocrine system disease', 'Musculoskeletal disease'], PathwayNames: VEGFR2 mediated cell proliferation\n\n2. MESH:D001849 refers to Endocrine Bone Diseases, defined by bone problems linked to endocrine gland malfunction, categorized as both an Endocrine system disease and a Musculoskeletal disease, and connected to the VEGFR2 mediated cell proliferation pathway.\n\n3. Summary: This row describes bone diseases originating from hormonal imbalances, indicating a link to vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 signaling and cellular growth processes within bone tissue.\n\n\n**Row 4:**\n\n1. **Column Names and Values:** DiseaseID: MESH:D001851, DiseaseName: Bone Diseases, Metabolic, DiseaseDescription: Diseases that affect the METABOLIC PROCESSES of BONE TISSUE., SlimMapping: ['Metabolic disease', 'Musculoskeletal disease'], PathwayNames: Vitamins\n\n2.  MESH:D001851 denotes Metabolic Bone Diseases, which disrupt bone tissue metabolic processes, classified as both Metabolic and Musculoskeletal diseases, and associated with Vitamin pathways.\n\n3. Summary: This row focuses on bone diseases resulting from metabolic dysfunction, suggesting that vitamin deficiencies or imbalances might play a crucial role in their etiology.\n\n\n**Row 5:**\n\n1. **Column Names and Values:** DiseaseID: MESH:D001847, DiseaseName: Bone Diseases, DiseaseDescription: Diseases of BONES., SlimMapping: ['Musculoskeletal disease'], PathwayNames: Viral carcinogenesis\n\n2.  The entry MESH:D001847 broadly defines Bone Diseases as musculoskeletal disorders and links them to viral carcinogenesis pathways.\n\n3. Summary: This row provides a general overview of bone diseases, suggesting a potential role of viral infections in their development."
