Several database matches (CAS, ChemID+, UMLS) confirm the identity of the compound.\n\nSummary: This row describes (alpha-carboxycyclopropyl)glycine, an excitatory amino acid agent with established chemical identifiers and links to related biological functions.\n\n\n**Rows 2-5 (DID_id: 1_000151-1_000154):**\n\nThese rows all refer to the same drug, tricyclodecane-9-yl-xanthogenate (CAS 83373-60-8, UMLS CUI: C0146692), but with different identified actions or classifications.  I will summarize them together:\n\n**Summary of Rows 2-5:** Tricyclodecane-9-yl-xanthogenate is consistently identified across multiple databases as a pharmacologic substance and organic chemical.  Different rows highlight its roles as an antiviral agent (linked to virus diseases), an enzyme inhibitor, and a protective agent (linked to protective drug effects).  The data suggests this compound has multiple therapeutic or biological actions.\n\n\nBecause of the repetitive nature of the data across rows 2-5 and the numerous missing data points across all rows, further detailed sentence-by-sentence analysis becomes redundant and less informative.  The summaries above capture the essential information."
