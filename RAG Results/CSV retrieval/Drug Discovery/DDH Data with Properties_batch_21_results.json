compound has moderate size and complexity,  lower hydrophobicity than the others, and shows low activity.\n\n\n**Overall Summary:** All four compounds share some structural similarities (indole-2,3-dione and thiophene moieties) and exhibit low activity (pIC50 values between -1.05 and -1.37).  They differ in size, complexity, and hydrophobicity, suggesting that these factors may not be the primary determinants of activity in this series.  Further investigation is needed to understand the structure-activity relationships."
