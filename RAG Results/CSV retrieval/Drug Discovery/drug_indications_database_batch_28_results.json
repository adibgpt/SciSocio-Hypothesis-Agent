The _ind_search field contains #VALUE!, indicating missing data.\n\n\nSummary Statement: This row details the chemical and pharmacological properties of tetra(4-N-methylpyridyl)porphine, classifying it as an angiogenesis modulator.  The multiple data sources corroborate the information, though one search field is missing.\n\n\n**DID_id: 1_000137 and DID_id: 1_000136**\n\nThese two rows are identical except for the `ind_raw_value` and related fields which describe different effects of N-nitroso-2,6-dimethylmorpholine.
