The structure features a butyl group and a cyclohexyl group, influencing its complexity (776.0) and contributing to its high RotatableBondCount (8.0).\n\n\n**Compound 5 (CID: 135411086):** Finally, compound 135411086, with SMILES COC(OC)C1=CC(O)=NC(SCC(=O)NC2=CC=C(C=C2)C(F)(F)F)=N1, has a molecular formula of C16H16F3N3O4S and a molecular weight of 403.4.  It exhibits an XLogP of 1.7 and a pIC50 of -2.3, indicating lower lipophilicity than the other compounds and weak activity.  The presence of a dimethoxymethyl group and a trifluoromethyl group affects its complexity (613.0) and high HBondAcceptorCount (9.0).\n\n\n\n**Summary:**\n\nAll five compounds show a pIC50 of -2.3, indicating similarly weak activity.  However, there is considerable variation in their XLogP values and structural complexity.  The compounds with higher XLogP values (CID 2744870, 135419065) tend to have higher molecular weights and greater structural complexity, suggesting that lipophilicity may be a factor influencing these properties. Further investigation is needed to determine the relationship between structure, lipophilicity, and activity."

three rotatable bonds, and a complexity of 595.0;  the presence of a piperidine ring and four hydrogen bond acceptors contributes to its pIC50 of -1.24, suggesting low activity.\n\n\nSummary: This compound has moderate size and complexity,  lower hydrophobicity than the others, and shows low activity.\n\n\n**Overall Summary:** All four compounds share some structural similarities (indole-2,3-dione and thiophene moieties) and exhibit low activity (pIC50 values between -1.05 and -1.37).  They differ in size, complexity, and hydrophobicity, suggesting that these factors may not be the primary determinants of activity in this series.  Further investigation is needed to understand the structure-activity relationships."
