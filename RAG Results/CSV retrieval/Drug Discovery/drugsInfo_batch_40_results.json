        "response": "Here's an analysis of the provided data, following the requested format.  Note that the data is presented as text, not a CSV file, so the \"column names\" are the descriptive labels used (e.g., DrugID, DrugName, etc.).\n\n**DrugID: DB00316**\n\n1. **Column Names and Values:** DrugID: DB00316, DrugName: Acetaminophen, DrugDescription: Analgesic and antipyretic drug used alone or with opioids, DrugTarget: ['P35354', 'P23219', 'Q15185', 'Q8NER1'], DrugPharmacodynamics:  Antipyretic and analgesic effects, lacks anti-inflammatory effects, does not disrupt uric acid secretion or acid-base balance at recommended doses, rare allergic reactions, DrugSmile: CC(=O)NC1=CC=C(O)C=C1, DrugMechanism: Inhibits COX pathways, central action to alleviate pain, does not inhibit peripheral COX,  DrugConditions: ['Airway secretion clearance therapy', 'Anti-spasmodics', 'Bronchodilation'], DrugCategories: ['Acetaminophen and Prodrugs', 'Amides', etc. (a long list of categories)].\n\n2. **Descriptive Sentence:** Acetaminophen (DB00316), an analgesic and antipyretic drug targeting specific proteins (P35354, P23219, Q15185, Q8NER1), works through central inhibition of COX pathways to alleviate pain without peripheral anti-inflammatory effects, exhibiting a chemical structure represented by CC(=O)NC1=CC=C(O)C=C1 and categorized as an acetaminophen, amide, and various other types of drug,  showing rare allergic reactions and use in airway secretion clearance therapy, among other conditions.\n\n3. **Summary Statement:** Acetaminophen is a widely categorized pain and fever reducer with a relatively well-understood mechanism, although its precise action remains partially unclear. Its lack of peripheral anti-inflammatory effects distinguishes it from other NSAIDs.\n\n\n**DrugID: DB00502**\n\n1. **Column Names and Values:** DrugID: DB00502, DrugName: Haloperidol, DrugDescription: Antipsychotic agent for schizophrenia and other psychoses, DrugTarget: ['P28335', 'P14416', etc. (a long list of targets)], DrugPharmacodynamics: Effective for positive schizophrenia symptoms, causes movement disorders and other side effects,  DrugSmile: OC1(CCN(CCCC(=O)C2=CC=C(F)C=C2)CC1)C1=CC=C(Cl)C=C1, DrugMechanism: Strong dopamine D2 receptor antagonist, improves psychotic symptoms by blocking dopamine overproduction,  DrugConditions: [], DrugCategories: ['Agents that reduce seizure threshold', 'Anti-Dyskinesia Agents', etc. (a long list of categories)].\n\n2. **Descriptive Sentence:** Haloperidol (DB00502), an antipsychotic targeting numerous proteins (P28335, P14416, etc.), effectively manages positive schizophrenia symptoms by antagonizing dopamine D2 receptors, as shown in its chemical structure OC1(CCN(CCCC(=O)C2=CC=C(F)C=C2)CC1)C1=CC=C(Cl)C=C1, but also causes significant movement disorders and other side effects, categorized as a first-generation antipsychotic, butyrophenone, and dopamine antagonist among others,  with its mechanism involving the inhibition of dopamine.\n\n3. **Summary Statement:** Haloperidol is a potent antipsychotic, but its efficacy is tempered by a high risk of extrapyramidal symptoms.  Its mechanism centers on dopamine D2 receptor antagonism.\n\n\n**DrugID: DB00688**\n\n1. **Column Names and Values:** DrugID: DB00688, DrugName: Mycophenolate mofetil, DrugDescription: Inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase inhibitor preventing transplant rejection, DrugTarget: ['P20839', 'P12268', 'Q03393'], DrugPharmacodynamics: Prodrug of mycophenolic acid (MPA), prevents immune cell proliferation and antibody formation, DrugSmile: COC1=C(C\\C=C(/C)CCC(=O)OCCN2CCOCC2)C(O)=C2C(=O)OCC2=C1C, DrugMechanism: MPA inhibits de novo purine biosynthesis, reduces immune cell production, DrugConditions: [], DrugCategories: ['Agents Causing Muscle Toxicity', 'Antimetabolite Immunosuppressant', etc. (a long list of categories)].\n\n2. **Descriptive Sentence:** Mycophenolate mofetil (DB00688), an immunosuppressant targeting specific proteins (P20839, P12268, Q03393),  prevents transplant rejection by inhibiting inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase (IMPDH), its active metabolite mycophenolic acid (MPA) disrupting purine biosynthesis and reducing immune cell proliferation,  represented chemically by COC1=C(C\\C=C(/C)CCC(=O)OCCN2CCOCC2)C(O)=C2C(=O)OCC2=C1C and categorized as an antimetabolite immunosuppressant and various other drug types.\n\n3. **Summary Statement:** Mycophenolate mofetil is a crucial immunosuppressant, working through its active metabolite to inhibit purine synthesis and thereby reduce immune response, thus preventing transplant rejection.\n\n\n**DrugID: DB01413**\n\n1. **Column Names and Values:** DrugID: DB01413, DrugName: Cefepime, DrugDescription: Fourth-generation cephalosporin antibiotic, DrugTarget: ['P02918', 'P02919', etc. (a list of targets)], DrugPharmacodynamics: Active against Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria, stable against beta-lactamases,  DrugSmile: CO\\N=C(/C(=O)N[C@@H]1C(=O)N2[C@]1([H])SCC(C[N+]1(C)CCCC1)=C2C([O-])=O)C1=CSC(N)=N1, DrugMechanism: Inhibits bacterial cell wall synthesis by binding to penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs), DrugConditions: [], DrugCategories: ['Amides', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents', etc. (a long list of categories)].\n\n2. **Descriptive Sentence:** Cefepime (DB01413), a fourth-generation cephalosporin antibiotic targeting penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) (P02918, P02919, etc.),  is effective against various Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria due to its stability against beta-lactamases,  with its chemical structure represented by CO\\N=C(/C(=O)N[C@@H]1C(=O)N2[C@]1([H])SCC(C[N+]1(C)CCCC1)=C2C([O-])=O)C1=CSC(N)=N1 and categorized as a cephalosporin and beta-lactam antibiotic among others,  its mechanism involves disrupting bacterial cell wall synthesis.\n\n3. **Summary Statement:** Cefepime is a broad-spectrum antibiotic effective against many bacteria resistant to earlier cephalosporins due to its resistance to beta-lactamase degradation.\n\n\n**DrugID: DB01388**\n\n1. **Column Names and Values:** DrugID: DB01388, DrugName: Mibefradil, DrugDescription: Withdrawn calcium channel blocker, DrugTarget: ['O43497', 'O95180', etc. (a list of targets)], DrugPharmacodynamics: Calcium channel blocker, relaxes blood vessels, DrugSmile: COCC(=O)O[C@]1(CCN(C)CCCC2=NC3=CC=CC=C3N2)CCC2=C(C=CC(F)=C2)[C@@H]1C(C)C, DrugMechanism: Inhibits T-type and L-type calcium channels, DrugConditions: [], DrugCategories: ['Agents causing hyperkalemia', 'Calcium Channel Blockers', etc. (a long list of categories)].\n\n2. **Descriptive Sentence:** Mibefradil (DB01388), a withdrawn calcium channel blocker targeting various calcium channel subunits (O43497, O95180, etc.),  relaxes blood vessels by inhibiting both T-type and L-type calcium channels,  represented chemically by COCC(=O)O[C@]1(CCN(C)CCCC2=NC3=CC=CC=C3N2)CCC2=C(C=CC(F)=C2)[C@@H]1C(C)C and categorized as a calcium channel blocker, among others, leading to its withdrawal due to drug interactions.\n\n3. **Summary Statement:** Mibefradil, a calcium channel blocker, was withdrawn from the market due to significant drug interaction risks, despite its effects on blood vessel relaxation through calcium channel inhibition."
