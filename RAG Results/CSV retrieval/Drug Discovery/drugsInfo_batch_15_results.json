Cisapride stimulates motility of the upper gastrointestinal tract without stimulating gastric, biliary, or pancreatic secretions. Cisapride increases the tone and amplitude of gastric (especially antral) contractions, relaxes the pyloric sphincter and the duodenal bulb, and increases peristalsis of the duodenum and jejunum resulting in accelerated gastric emptying and intestinal transit. It increases the resting tone of the lower esophageal sphincter. It has little, if any, effect on the motility of the colon or gallbladder. Cisapride does not induce muscarinic or nicotinic receptor stimulation, nor does it inhibit acetylcholinesterase activity., DrugSmile: CO[C@H]1CN(CCCOC2=CC=C(F)C=C2)CC[C@H]1NC(=O)C1=CC(Cl)=C(N)C=C1OC, DrugMechanism: Cisapride acts through the stimulation of the serotonin -HTreceptors which increases acetylcholine release in the enteric nervous system (specifically the myenteric plexus).

Alkylating agents are so named because of their ability to add alkyl groups to many electronegative groups under conditions present in cells. They stop tumor growth by cross-linking guanine bases in DNA double-helix strands - directly attacking DNA. This makes the strands unable to uncoil and separate. As this is necessary in DNA replication, the cells can no longer divide. In addition, these drugs add methyl or other alkyl groups onto molecules where they do not belong which in turn inhibits their correct utilization by base pairing and causes a miscoding of DNA. Alkylating agents are cell cycle-nonspecific. Alkylating agents work by three different mechanisms all of which achieve the same end result - disruption of DNA function and cell death., DrugSmile: ClCCN(CCCl)P1(=O)NCCCO1, DrugMechanism: Alkylating agents work by three different mechanisms: ) attachment of alkyl groups to DNA bases, resulting in the DNA being fragmented by repair enzymes in their attempts to replace the alkylated bases, preventing DNA synthesis and RNA transcription from the affected DNA, ) DNA damage via the formation of cross-links (bonds between atoms in the DNA) which prevents DNA from being separated for synthesis or transcription, and ) the induction of mispairing of the nucleotides leading to mutations., TargetActionsOrganism: ADNA cross-linking/alkylation Humans, UNuclear receptor subfamily  group I member Not Available Humans, DrugConditions: [], DrugCategories: ['Alkylating Activity', 'Alkylating Drugs', 'Antineoplastic Agents', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating', 'Antineoplastic and Immunomodulating Agents', 'Antirheumatic Agents', 'Cardiotoxic antineoplastic agents', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP2A6 Substrates', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP2A6 Substrates with a Narrow Therapeutic Index', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP2B6 Inducers', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP2B6 Inducers (strength unknown)', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP2B6 Substrates', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP2B6 Substrates with a Narrow Therapeutic Index', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP2C18 Substrates', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP2C18 Substrates with a Narrow Therapeutic Index', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP2C19 Substrates', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP2C19 Substrates with a Narrow Therapeutic Index', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP2C8 Inducers', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP2C8 Inducers (strength unknown)', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP2C8 Substrates', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP2C8 Substrates with a Narrow Therapeutic Index', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP2C9 Substrates', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP2C9 Substrates with a Narrow Therapeutic Index', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A Inducers', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A Substrates', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A4 Inducers', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A4 Inducers (strength unknown)', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A4 Substrates', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A4 Substrates with a Narrow Therapeutic Index', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A5 Substrates', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A5 Substrates with a Narrow Therapeutic Index', 'Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme Inducers', 'Cytochrome P-450 Substrates', 'Hydrocarbons, Halogenated', 'Immunologic Factors', 'Immunosuppressive Agents', 'Methemoglobinemia Associated Agents', 'Mustard Compounds', 'Mutagens', 'Myeloablative Agonists', 'Myelosuppressive Agents', 'Narrow Therapeutic Index Drugs', 'Neurotoxic agents', 'Nitrogen Mustard Analogues', 'Nitrogen Mustard Compounds', 'Noxae', 'Organophosphorus Compounds', 'Phosphoramide Mustards', 'Phosphoramides', 'Toxic Actions']\n\n2. **Sentence Description:** Cyclophosphamide (DB00531), a nitrogen mustard alkylating agent used to treat various cancers, targets the protein O75469 and works by alkylating DNA bases, forming DNA cross-links, and inducing nucleotide mispairing, ultimately disrupting DNA function and causing cell death; its chemical structure is ClCCN(CCCl)P1(=O)NCCCO1, and it's categorized as an antineoplastic agent, alkylating drug, and mutagen, among other classifications related to its cytotoxic and immunomodulatory effects.\n\n3. **Summary Statement:** Cyclophosphamide is a potent alkylating agent used in cancer chemotherapy.

This response later declines to baseline with long-term use of atenolol. More importantly, this reduction in the work demanded of the myocardium also reduces oxygen demand which provides therapeutic benefit by reducing the mismatch of oxygen supply and demand in settings where coronary blood flow is limited, such as in coronary atherosclerosis. Reducing oxygen demand, particularly due to exercise, can reduce the frequency of angina pectoris symptoms and potentially improve survival of the remaining myocardium after myocardial infarction. The decrease in rate of sinoatrial node potentials, electrical conduction, slowing of potentials traveling through the atrioventricular node, and reduced frequency of ectopic potentials due to blockade of adrenergic beta receptors has led to benefit in arrhythmic conditions such as atrial fibrillation by controlling the rate of action potential generation and allowing for more effective coordinated contractions. Since a degree of sympathetic activity is necessary to maintain cardiac function, the reduced contractility induced by atenolol may precipitate or worsen heart failure, especially during volume overload.LabelThe effects of atenolol on blood pressure have been established, although it is less effective than alternative beta-blockers, but the mechanism has not yet been characterized.Label,24As a \u03b21 selective drug, it does not act via the vasodilation produced by non-selective agents.24Despite this there is a sustained reduction in peripheral vascular resistance, and consequently blood pressure, alongside a decrease in cardiac output. It is thought that atenolol's antihypertensive activity may be related to action on the central nervous system (CNS) or it's inhibition of the renin-aldosterone-angiotensin system rather than direct effects on the vasculature.LabelAtenolol produces CNS effects similar to other beta-blockers, but does so to a lesser extent due to reduces ability to cross the blood-brain barrier.24It has the potential to produce fatigue, depression, and sleep disturbances such as nightmares or insomnia.Label,24The exact mechanisms behind these have not been characterized but their occurrence must be considered as they represent clinically relevant adverse effects.Atenolol exerts some effects on the respiratory system although to a much lesser extent than non-selective beta-blockers.LabelInteraction with \u03b22 receptors in the airways can produce bronchoconstriction by blocking the relaxation of bronchial smooth muscle mediated by the sympathetic nervous system.24The same action can interfere with \u03b2-agonist therapies used in asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.Label,14,24Unlike some other beta-blocker drugs, atenolol does not have intrinsic sympathomimetic or membrane stabilizing activity nor does it produce changes in glycemic control.Label, DrugSmile: CC(C)NCC(O)COC1=CC=C(CC(N)=O)C=C1, DrugMechanism: Atenolol is a cardioselective beta-blocker, called such because it selectively binds to the \u03b2-adrenergic receptor as an antagonist up to a reported  fold more than \u03b2 receptors.Selective activity at the \u03b2 receptor produces cardioselectivity due to the higher population of this receptor in cardiac tissue. Some binding to \u03b2 and possibly \u03b2 receptors can still occur at therapeutic dosages but the effects mediated by antagonizing these are significantly reduced from those of non-selective agents. \u03b2 and \u03b2 receptors are Gscoupled therefore antagonism of their activation reduces activity of adenylyl cyclase and its downstream signalling via cyclic adenosime monophosphate and protein kinase A (PKA).In cardiomyocytes PKA is thought to mediate activation of L-type calcium channels and ryanodine receptors through their phosphorylation.L-type calcium channels can then provide an initial rise in intracellular calcium and trigger the ryanodine receptors to release calcium stored in the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) and increased contractility. PKA also plays a role in the cessation of contraction by phosphorylating phospholamban which in turn increases the affinity of SR Ca+ATPase to increase reuptake of calcium into the SR. It also phophorylates troponin I to reduce affinity of the protein for calcium. Both of these events lead to a reduction in contraction which, when coupled with the initial increase in contraction, allows for faster cycling and consequently higher heart rate with increased contractility. L-type calcium channels are also a major contributor to cardiac depolarization and their activation can increase frequency of action potentials and possibly the incidence of ectopic potentials.Similar inihibitory events occur in the bronchial smooth muscle to mediate relaxation including phosphorylation of myosin light-chain kinase, reducing its affinity for calcium.PKA also inhibits the excitatory Gqcoupled pathway by phosphorylating the inositol trisphosphate receptor and phospholipase C resulting in inhibition of intracellular calcium release. Antagonism of this activity by beta-blocker agents like atenolol can thus cause increased bronchoconstriction., TargetActionsOrganism: ABeta- adrenergic receptor antagonist Humans, UBeta- adrenergic receptor antagonist Humans, DrugConditions: [], DrugCategories: ['Adrenergic Agents', 'Adrenergic Antagonists', 'Adrenergic beta-1 Receptor Antagonists', 'Adrenergic beta-Antagonists', 'Agents causing hyperkalemia', 'Alcohols', 'Amines', 'Amino Alcohols', 'Antiarrhythmic agents', 'Antihypertensive Agents', 'Antihypertensive Agents Indicated for Hypertension', 'Autonomic Agents', 'Beta blocking agents and calcium channel blockers', 'Beta Blocking Agents and Thiazides', 'Beta Blocking Agents, Selective', 'Beta Blocking Agents, Selective, and Thiazides', 'Beta-Blockers (Beta1 Selective)', 'Bradycardia-Causing Agents', 'BSEP/ABCB11 Substrates', 'Cardiovascular Agents', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP2D6 Substrates', 'Cytochrome P-450 Substrates', 'Hypotensive Agents', 'Peripheral Nervous System Agents', 'QTc shortening agents', 'Sympatholytics']\n\n2. **Sentence Description:** Atenolol (DB00335), a beta-1 selective blocker used to treat hypertension, angina, and myocardial infarction, targets the proteins P08588 and P07550 and acts as a beta-adrenergic receptor antagonist, reducing heart rate and contractility by blocking sympathetic innervation, thereby decreasing myocardial oxygen demand and potentially improving survival after infarction; its chemical structure is CC(C)NCC(O)COC1=CC=C(CC(N)=O)C=C1, and it's categorized as a beta-blocker, antihypertensive agent, and cardiovascular agent, among other classifications reflecting its effects on the cardiovascular and nervous systems.\n\n3. **Summary Statement:** Atenolol is a cardioselective beta-blocker primarily used for cardiovascular indications.

Firstly, DHE's s agonist action on -hydroxytryptamine (HT) b receptors in the smooth muscle of the cranial vasculature may provide relief via vasoconstriction of the blood vessels which typically become dilated due to the release of CGRP during migraine attacks.,DHE's off-target action at alpha-adrenergic receptors may further contribute via this mechanism. The remaining mechanisms are thought to provide relief through the effects on the neurogenic causes of migraine symptoms. Agonist action by DHE on -HTband -HTdreceptors inhibits nociceptive signalling through the ventroposteromedial thalamus to the trigeminal sensory neurons. Further action on -HTband -HTdreceptors with the addition of agonist activity on -HTfin the trigeminal nucleus caudalis decreases afferent signalling to trigeminal sensory neurons which contributes to central sensitization. The success of experimental compounds selectively targetting the -HTfreceptor lends support to this mechanism. Lastly, action at -HTdreceptors on trigeminal nerve terminals inhibits the release of vasoactive neuropeptides thought to contribute to pain and inflammation during a migraine attack. DHE is known to have -fold less potency at the -HTbreceptor than its predecessor ergotamine which reduces the incidence of vascular side effects.Notably, DHE slowly diffuses from receptors resulting in unreliable prediction of effects from plasma concentration., TargetActionsOrganism: A-hydroxytryptamine receptor B agonist Humans, A-hydroxytryptamine receptor D agonist Humans, A-hydroxytryptamine receptor F agonist Humans, UAlpha-A adrenergic receptor agonist Humans, U-hydroxytryptamine receptor A agonist Humans, U-hydroxytryptamine receptor E agonist Humans, U-hydroxytryptamine receptor A agonist Humans, U-hydroxytryptamine receptor B agonist Humans, U-hydroxytryptamine receptor C agonist Humans, UAlpha- adrenergic receptors agonist Humans, UAlpha- adrenergic receptors agonist Humans, UDopamine D receptor agonist Humans, UDopamine D receptor agonist Humans, UDopamine D receptor agonist Humans, U-hydroxytryptamine receptor agonist Humans, UBeta- adrenergic receptor agonist Humans, DrugConditions: [], DrugCategories: ['Adrenergic alpha-1 Receptor Antagonists', 'Adrenergic alpha-Antagonists', 'Adrenergic Antagonists', 'Agents that produce hypertension', 'Alkaloids', 'Analgesics', 'Antidepressive Agents', 'Antimigraine Preparations', 'Cardiovascular Agents', 'Central Nervous System Agents', 'Central Nervous System Depressants', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A Inhibitors', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A Substrates', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A4 Inhibitors', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A4 Inhibitors (strength unknown)', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A4 Substrates', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A4 Substrates with a Narrow Therapeutic Index', 'Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme Inhibitors', 'Cytochrome P-450 Substrates', 'Dopamine Agents', 'Dopamine Agonists', 'Ergot Alkaloids and Derivatives', 'Ergot-derivative Dopamine Receptor Agonists', 'Ergotamine Derivative', 'Ergotamines', 'Heterocyclic Compounds, Fused-Ring', 'Narrow Therapeutic Index Drugs', 'Nervous System', 'Neurotransmitter Agents', 'P-glycoprotein inhibitors', 'Peripheral Nervous System Agents', 'Sensory System Agents', 'Serotonergic Drugs Shown to Increase Risk of Serotonin Syndrome', 'Serotonin 5-HT1 Receptor Agonists', 'Serotonin 5-HT2 Receptor Agonists', 'Serotonin Agents', 'Serotonin Modulators', 'Serotonin Receptor Agonists', 'Sympatholytic (Adrenergic Blocking) Agents', 'Vasoconstrictor Agents']\n\n2. **Sentence Description:** Dihydroergotamine (DB00320), an ergot alkaloid used to treat migraine and cluster headaches, targets numerous proteins (P28222, P28221, P30939, etc.) and exerts its effects through both neurological and vascular mechanisms, including serotonin receptor agonism, which may decrease trigeminal system activity and cause vasoconstriction, counteracting migraine-associated vasodilation; its chemical structure is represented by the SMILES string [H][C@@]12CCCN1C(=O)[C@H](CC1=CC=CC=C1)N1C(=O)[C@](C)(NC(=O)[C@H]3CN(C)[C@]4([H])CC5=CNC6=CC=CC(=C56)[C@@]4([H])C3)O[C@@]21O, and it is classified as an antimigraine preparation, ergot alkaloid, and vasoconstrictor agent, among other categories.\n\n3. **Summary Statement:** Dihydroergotamine is an antimigraine drug with a complex mechanism involving both vasoconstriction and modulation of neurotransmission in the trigeminal system.

It is through the downstream effects of 5-HT1B/1Dactivation that triptans are proposed to provide acute relief of migraines.14,1,2Zolmitriptan is also a vasoconstrictor,5leading to possible adverse cardiovascular effects such as myocardial ischemia/infarction, arrhythmias, cerebral and subarachnoid hemorrhage, stroke, gastrointestinal ischemia, and peripheral vasospastic reactions. In addition, chest/throat/neck/jaw pain, tightness, and/or pressure has been reported, along with the possibility of medication overuse headaches and serotonin syndrome. Patients with phenylketonuria should be advised that ZOMIG-ZMT contains phenylalanine.14, DrugSmile: CN(C)CCC1=CNC2=CC=C(C[C@H]3COC(=O)N3)C=C12, DrugMechanism: Migraines are complex physiological events characterized by unilateral throbbing headaches combined with photophobia and other aversions to sensory input. Migraine attacks are generally divided into phases: the premonitory phase, which typically involves irritability, fatigue, yawning, and stiff neck; the headache phase, which lasts for between four and  hours; and the postdrome phase, which lasts for up to a day following resolution of pain and whose symptoms are similar to those of the premonitory phase. In addition, neurological deficits, collectively termed migraine aura, may precede the headache phase.,The underlying pathophysiology of migraines is a matter of active research but involves both neurological and vascular components. The head pain associated with migraine is thought to be a consequence of activation of the nociceptive nerves comprising the trigeminocervical complex (TCC).Terminals of nociceptive nerves that innervate the dura matter release vasoactive peptides, such as calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), resulting in cranial vasodilation. Finally, when present, migraine aura appears to correlate with a transient wave(s) of cortical depolarization, termed cortical spreading depression (CSD).,Triptans, including zolmitriptan, are proposed to act in three ways. The main mechanism is through modulation of nociceptive nerve signalling in the central nervous system through -HTB/Dreceptors throughout the TCC and associated areas of the brain. In addition, triptans can enhance vasoconstriction, both through direct -HTB-mediated dilation of cranial blood vessels,,as well as through -HTD-mediated suppression of CGRP release.,Although triptans are classically described solely in terms of their effects on -HTB/Dreceptors, they also act as -HTFagonists as well. This -HT subtype is also found throughout the TCC, but is not present appreciably in cerebral vasculature; the significance of triptan-mediated -HTFactivation is currently not well described.Additionally, CSD that initiates in the ipsilateral parietal region may exert its effects in a manner that relies on -HTB/Dreceptor activation, suggesting that triptans may have some effect on CSD-mediated symptoms., TargetActionsOrganism: A-hydroxytryptamine receptor B agonist Humans, A-hydroxytryptamine receptor D agonist Humans, A-hydroxytryptamine receptor F agonist Humans, U-hydroxytryptamine receptor E agonist Humans, N-hydroxytryptamine receptor agonist Humans, N-hydroxytryptamine receptor A agonist Humans, N-hydroxytryptamine receptor A agonist Humans, N-hydroxytryptamine receptor B agonist Humans, DrugConditions: [], DrugCategories: ['Agents that produce hypertension', 'Amines', 'Analgesics', 'Antidepressive Agents', 'Antimigraine Preparations', 'Biogenic Amines', 'Biogenic Monoamines', 'Central Nervous System Depressants', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP1A2 Substrates', 'Cytochrome P-450 Substrates', 'Heterocyclic Compounds, Fused-Ring', 'Indoles', 'Monoamine Oxidase A Substrates', 'Nervous System', 'Neurotransmitter Agents', 'Oxazoles', 'Selective Serotonin 5-HT1 Receptor Agonists', 'Selective Serotonin Agonists', 'Serotonergic Drugs Shown to Increase Risk of Serotonin Syndrome', 'Serotonin 1b Receptor Agonists', 'Serotonin 1d Receptor Agonists', 'Serotonin 5-HT1 Receptor Agonists', 'Serotonin Agents', 'Serotonin Modulators', 'Serotonin Receptor Agonists', 'Serotonin-1b and Serotonin-1d Receptor Agonist', 'Triptans']\n\n2. **Sentence Description:** Zolmitriptan (DB00315), a triptan used to treat migraine, targets serotonin receptors (5-HT1B, 5-HT1D, 5-HT1F) and acts as an agonist, modulating nociceptive signaling in the trigeminocervical complex and potentially affecting cortical spreading depression; it also causes vasoconstriction, leading to potential cardiovascular side effects;  its chemical structure is CN(C)CCC1=CNC2=CC=C(C[C@H]3COC(=O)N3)C=C12, and it is classified as a triptan, antimigraine agent, and serotonin receptor agonist, among other categories related to its effects on the nervous system and its potential cardiovascular effects.\n\n3. **Summary Statement:** Zolmitriptan is a triptan used for acute migraine treatment.
