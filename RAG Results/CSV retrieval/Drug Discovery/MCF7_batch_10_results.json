        "response": "The provided text is not a CSV file, but a series of records with the same molregno (78759),  representing Doxorubicin's activity against MCF7 cells (breast carcinoma) in different disease contexts.  Each record shows Doxorubicin's  IC50 value (in varying units) against MCF7 cells,  associated with different diseases (Stomach Neoplasms, Rhabdomyosarcoma, Ovarian Neoplasms, Liver Neoplasms, and again Ovarian Neoplasms), and consistent physicochemical properties (molecular weight 543.53, alogP 0.00, HBA 12, HBD 6, PSA 206.07, RTB 5,  Ro3_pass N, num_ro5_violations 3, cx_logP 0.53, cx_logD 0.10, molecular_species BASE, qed_weighted 0.24, np_likeness_score 1.81).  The variability in IC50 values (0.38 \u00b5g/mL, 170 nM, 5 \u00b5g, 26900 nM, 0.87 \u00b5g/mL) suggests differing sensitivities of MCF7 cells to Doxorubicin depending on the associated disease context, highlighting the complexity of drug response and the need for further investigation into the relationship between disease type and drug efficacy.  The consistent physicochemical properties across all records confirm that the data refers to the same molecule, Doxorubicin."
