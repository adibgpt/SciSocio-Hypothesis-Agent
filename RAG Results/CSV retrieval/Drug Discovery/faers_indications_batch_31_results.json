This indicates that Alirocumab is used to treat various forms of high cholesterol and related cardiovascular conditions.\n\n**Row 2 (ID: 150):** Asenapine (Asenapine Maleate, Saphris), with RXCUI 784649, treats bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, depression, psychotic disorders, and schizoaffective disorder, corresponding to MONDO codes MONDO:0004985, MONDO:0005090, MONDO:0002050, MONDO:0005485, and MONDO:0005487, and UMLS codes C0005586, C0036341, C0011570, C0033975, and C0036337.
