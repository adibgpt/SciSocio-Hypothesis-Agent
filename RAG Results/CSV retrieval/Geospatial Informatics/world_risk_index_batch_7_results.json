        "response": "Here's an analysis of the provided data, presented as requested:\n\n\n**Vietnam (2011):**  In 2011, Vietnam had a Water Risk Index (WRI) of 11.21 (Very High category), an exposure score of 22.02 (Very High), vulnerability of 50.89 (Medium), susceptibility of 30.82 (Medium), lack of coping capabilities of 78.88, and lack of adaptive capacities of 42.97.  Despite very high exposure, Vietnam's medium vulnerability suggests relatively strong adaptive capacities compared to its lack of coping capabilities.  The high lack of coping capabilities is a concern despite the medium vulnerability score.\n\n\n**Sierra Leone (2011):** In 2011, Sierra Leone exhibited a very high Water Risk Index (WRI) of 11.25, a high exposure score of 15.31, very high vulnerability (73.5), very high susceptibility (64.79), a very high lack of coping capabilities (89.09), and a high lack of adaptive capacities (66.62). Sierra Leone's high WRI is driven by extremely high vulnerability and susceptibility, indicating a significant lack of both coping and adaptive capacities to manage water-related risks.\n\n\n**Haiti (2011):** In 2011, Haiti also showed a very high Water Risk Index (WRI) of 11.45, a high exposure score of 15.95, very high vulnerability (71.77), very high susceptibility (64.03), extremely high lack of coping capabilities (89.46), and high lack of adaptive capacities (61.83). Similar to Sierra Leone, Haiti's very high WRI reflects exceptionally high vulnerability and susceptibility, compounded by severely limited coping and adaptive capacities in the face of water-related risks.\n\n\n**Japan (2011):** In 2011, Japan, despite a very high exposure score of 39.57, had a high but comparatively lower Water Risk Index (WRI) of 11.13.  This is because of its very low vulnerability (28.13) and very low susceptibility (16.3), indicating strong coping (36.66) and adaptive capacities (31.44). Japan\u2019s high exposure is mitigated by its substantial capacity to adapt to and cope with water-related challenges.\n\n\n**Mali (2011):** In 2011, Mali recorded a very high Water Risk Index (WRI) of 11.51, a high exposure score of 16.59, very high vulnerability (69.35), very high susceptibility (54.74), high lack of coping capabilities (85.45), and high lack of adaptive capacities (67.85). Mali's high WRI stems from its high vulnerability and susceptibility, reflecting significant limitations in coping and adaptive capacities to manage water-related risks."
