        "response": "Here's an analysis of the provided data, presented as requested:\n\n\n**Mosambik (2011):**  In Mosambik during 2011,  a high Water Risk Index (WRI) of 9.98, coupled with medium exposure (13.86), resulted in very high vulnerability (71.95) driven by very high susceptibility (68.19), a significant lack of coping capabilities (86.16), and a substantial lack of adaptive capacities (61.52).  This indicates a high level of risk and a critical need for improved resilience strategies.\n\n\n**Albanien (2011):** In Albanien in 2011, a high Water Risk Index (WRI) of 9.98, despite very high exposure (22.47), surprisingly resulted in low vulnerability (44.42) due to low susceptibility (20.04), although  lack of coping capabilities (74.31) and lack of adaptive capacities (38.91) were notable. This suggests that despite high exposure, effective coping and adaptive mechanisms mitigate the overall vulnerability.\n\n\n**Benin (2011):** In Benin during 2011, a high Water Risk Index (WRI) of 10.9, combined with high exposure (16.2), led to very high vulnerability (67.24) characterized by very high susceptibility (54.87),  a high lack of coping capabilities (84.9), and a substantial lack of adaptive capacities (61.94). This highlights a critical need for interventions to enhance resilience to water-related risks.\n\n\n**Kamerun (2011):** In Kamerun in 2011, a high Water Risk Index (WRI) of 10.27, along with high exposure (16.23), contributed to high vulnerability (63.29) stemming from high susceptibility (47.62),  a high lack of coping capabilities (85.82), and a moderate lack of adaptive capacities (56.42).  This suggests a considerable level of risk requiring focused efforts to improve adaptive capacity.\n\n\n**Togo (2011):** In Togo during 2011, a high Water Risk Index (WRI) of 10.4, coupled with high exposure (14.98), resulted in very high vulnerability (69.45) due to very high susceptibility (58.26),  a very high lack of coping capabilities (87.49), and a substantial lack of adaptive capacities (62.59). This underlines a severe vulnerability to water-related risks and the urgent need for comprehensive adaptation strategies."
