        "response": "Here's an analysis of the provided data, presented as requested:\n\n\n**Row 1 (Year 2010):**  In Angola (AGO) during 2010, the SDG index score was 51.8, with individual goal scores ranging from a low of 5.4 (Goal 9) to a high of 93.7 (Goal 12).  Goal 1 and Goal 2 both scored 55.1, while Goal 3 (29.6) and Goal 7 (25.3) indicated significant challenges.  This suggests a relatively balanced performance across SDGs, but with notable weaknesses in areas like industry, innovation, and infrastructure (Goal 9) and good health and well-being (Goal 3).\n\n\n**Row 2 (Year 2007):** Angola (AGO) in 2007 had an SDG index score of 49, showing lower performance compared to 2010.  Goal scores varied, with Goal 8 (63.7) performing strongly, while Goal 3 (25.9) and Goal 10 (15.5) demonstrated considerable room for improvement.  The lower SDG index score in 2007 compared to 2010 suggests potential progress in several areas over time.\n\n\n**Row 3 (Year 2008):**  The SDG index score for Angola (AGO) in 2008 was 51.4, indicating some improvement from 2007.  Similar to previous years, Goal 8 (63.6) performed well, and Goal 3 (26.3) and Goal 9 (5.3) lagged.  The slight increase in the SDG index score reflects a modest year-on-year improvement, though many challenges remain.\n\n\n**Row 4 (Year 2009):**  Angola's (AGO) SDG index score in 2009 was 50.9.  Goal scores show continued strong performance in Goal 8 (63.7) and Goal 12 (93.3), but persistent weakness in Goal 9 (5.3).  The SDG index score shows a slight decrease compared to 2008, suggesting some stagnation in overall progress.\n\n\n**Row 5 (Year 2006):** In 2006, Angola (AGO) achieved an SDG index score of 48.6.  The data reveals Goal 8 (63.7) consistently performing well across years, while Goal 3 (23.8) and Goal 10 (15.5) consistently showed lower scores, highlighting persistent challenges in health and reduced inequalities. The lower SDG index score in 2006 compared to subsequent years suggests improvement over time."
