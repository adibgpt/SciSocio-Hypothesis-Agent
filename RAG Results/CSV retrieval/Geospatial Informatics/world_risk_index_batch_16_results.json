        "response": "Here's an analysis of the provided data, following the requested format:\n\n\n**Dschibuti (2011):**  In Dschibuti in 2011, the Water Risk Index (WRI) was 7.05 (Medium category), indicating a moderate water risk, despite low exposure (11.14) to water-related hazards.  However, the high vulnerability score (63.29, High category), driven by high susceptibility (40.08, High category), a significant lack of coping capabilities (83.56), and a substantial lack of adaptive capacities (66.22), suggests a considerable risk of negative impacts from water stress despite relatively low exposure.  This highlights the vulnerability of Dschibuti to water-related challenges despite relatively low exposure.\n\n\n**Griechenland (2011):** In Griechenland in 2011, the country experienced very high exposure (20.89) to water-related hazards, yet a relatively low vulnerability score of 33.94 (Very Low category). This low vulnerability is attributed to low susceptibility (16.22, Very Low category), moderate lack of coping capabilities (53.29), and low lack of adaptive capacities (32.32). Despite the high exposure, Greece demonstrated a relatively low overall water risk (WRI 7.09, Medium category) due to its robust adaptive and coping mechanisms.\n\n\n**Zentralafrikanische Republik (2011):** In the Central African Republic in 2011, a low exposure level (9.91) was counterbalanced by an extremely high vulnerability score (72.42, Very High category). This high vulnerability stemmed from very high susceptibility (63.34, Very High category), extremely high lack of coping capabilities (91.2), and high lack of adaptive capacities (62.72), resulting in a moderate WRI of 7.18 (Medium category).  Despite low exposure, the Central African Republic faced a severe water risk due to extremely limited coping and adaptive capacities.\n\n\n**Marokko (2011):** In Morocco in 2011, a medium level of exposure (13.41) coupled with a medium vulnerability score (53.49, Medium category) resulted in a moderate WRI of 7.17 (Medium category). This medium vulnerability was a consequence of medium susceptibility (29.72, Medium category), high lack of coping capabilities (77.12), and moderate lack of adaptive capacities (53.64). Morocco showed a moderate level of water risk, balanced between exposure and vulnerability components.\n\n\n**Eritrea (2011):** In Eritrea in 2011, the low exposure (9.9) contrasted sharply with the very high vulnerability (72.88, Very High category), resulting in a moderate WRI of 7.22 (Medium category). This high vulnerability was due to very high susceptibility (67.17, Very High category), high lack of coping capabilities (87.68), and substantial lack of adaptive capacities (63.79).  Similar to the Central African Republic, Eritrea's high vulnerability, despite low exposure, points to significant challenges in managing water resources."
