        "response": "Here's an analysis of the provided data, presented as requested:\n\n\n**Island (2011):**  In 2011, the Island region exhibited a very low Water Resources Index (WRI) of 1.56, very low exposure (6.22), and very low vulnerability (25.01), primarily driven by very low susceptibility (14.06),  moderate lack of coping capabilities (37.04), and moderate lack of adaptive capacities (23.94).  Summary: Despite moderate deficiencies in coping and adaptive capacities, the Island region showed very low overall vulnerability to water stress in 2011, likely due to low exposure and susceptibility.\n\n\n**Schweden (2011):** In 2011, Sweden (Schweden) showed a very low WRI of 2.0, very low exposure (8.14), and very low vulnerability (24.57), characterized by very low susceptibility (14.34), and moderate lack of coping capabilities (35.46) and adaptive capacities (23.91). Summary: Similar to the Island region, Sweden exhibited low vulnerability to water stress in 2011, indicating a robust water management system despite moderate limitations in coping and adaptive capacities.\n\n\n**Bahrain (2011):** In 2011, Bahrain registered a very low WRI of 1.66 and very low exposure (4.03), but showed low vulnerability (41.27) due to significantly higher lack of coping capabilities (61.07) and adaptive capacities (47.01) compared to Sweden and the Island region, despite maintaining very low susceptibility (15.74). Summary:  Bahrain's low vulnerability score is misleading; while exposure and susceptibility were low, significant weaknesses in coping and adaptive capacities suggest a higher risk of water stress than the overall vulnerability score indicates.\n\n\n**Kiribati (2011):**  In 2011, Kiribati had a very low WRI of 1.88 and very low exposure (3.31), but displayed high vulnerability (56.87) because of extremely high lack of coping capabilities (83.54) and high lack of adaptive capacities (45.56), coupled with high susceptibility (41.52). Summary: Kiribati faced a high vulnerability to water stress in 2011 despite low exposure, primarily due to severe limitations in coping and adaptive mechanisms and high susceptibility.\n\n\n**Finnland (2011):** In 2011, Finland (Finnland) had a very low WRI of 2.06, very low exposure (8.14), and very low vulnerability (25.27),  stemming from very low susceptibility (14.67) and moderate lack of coping capabilities (36.55) and adaptive capacities (24.59). Summary: Similar to Sweden and the Island region, Finland displayed low vulnerability to water stress in 2011, suggesting effective water management strategies despite moderate limitations in coping and adaptive capacities."
