        "response": "Here's an analysis of the provided data, presented as requested:\n\n\n**Germany (DEU):**  Germany, an OECD country, achieved an overall score of 83.36, reflecting performance across 17 goals.  Specifically, Germany scored exceptionally high in Goals 1 (99.51), 3 (93.04), 4 (97.16), and 9 (95.79), indicating strong performance in areas like poverty reduction and industry, innovation, and infrastructure. However, scores in Goals 2 (72.37), 7 (77.16), 12 (55.41), and 13 (64.00) suggest areas needing improvement, particularly in zero hunger, affordable and clean energy, responsible consumption and production, and climate action.  Overall, Germany demonstrates a mixed performance, excelling in some areas while lagging in others.\n\n\n**Sweden (SWE):** Sweden, also an OECD member, obtained a higher overall score of 85.98.  Its impressive performance is highlighted by high scores across various goals, particularly in Goals 1 (98.89), 3 (96.90), 4 (99.76), 5 (91.44), 6 (95.06), 7 (97.97), 9 (97.59), and 10 (94.97), demonstrating strength in areas like poverty reduction, health, education, gender equality, clean water and sanitation, and reduced inequalities.  Despite this,  Goals 2 (63.07) and 12 (56.83) reveal room for improvement in zero hunger and responsible consumption and production.  Sweden showcases a consistently high level of achievement across most sustainable development goals.\n\n\n**Denmark (DNK):** Denmark, another OECD country, achieved an overall score of 85.68, slightly lower than Sweden.  While exhibiting high scores in Goals 1 (99.22), 3 (95.40), 4 (99.34), 9 (96.98), and 10 (98.16), indicating success in poverty reduction, health, education, industry, innovation, and reduced inequalities, its performance in Goals 2 (71.03), 12 (44.57), and 13 (60.78) reveals areas needing attention, especially in zero hunger, responsible consumption and production, and climate action.  Denmark's performance is strong overall but shows clear imbalances.\n\n\n**Austria (AUT):** Austria, an OECD country, received an overall score of 82.28.  Similar to other countries, Austria excels in Goals 1 (99.45), 3 (92.47), 4 (97.91), and 9 (96.98) but struggles with Goals 2 (73.07) and 12 (49.62), indicating a need for focus on zero hunger and responsible consumption and production. The missing data for Goal 14 prevents a complete assessment. Austria demonstrates a pattern consistent with other OECD nations, excelling in certain areas while needing improvement in others.\n\n\n**Finland (FIN):** Finland, an OECD nation, scored 86.76 overall.  High scores in goals 1 (99.58), 3 (95.39), 4 (97.17), 9 (95.99), and 10 (98.47) highlight strengths in areas like poverty reduction, health, education, industry, innovation, and reduced inequalities.  However, Goal 2 (60.89) and Goal 12 (60.06) require attention, indicating a need to address zero hunger and responsible consumption and production. Finland, like other OECD countries, displays a mixed performance across the sustainable development goals."
