        "response": "Here's an analysis of the provided data, presented as requested:\n\n\n**Row 1 (Year 2007):**  In 2007, Azerbaijan (AZE) achieved an SDG index score of 67.6,  with a perfect score of 100 on Goal 1 but relatively lower scores in other goals, such as 59.2 on Goal 2 (Zero Hunger) and 57.6 on Goal 3 (Good Health and Well-being).  Goal 14 (Life Below Water) scored 0.  This suggests a strong performance in poverty reduction (Goal 1) but significant room for improvement in other areas of sustainable development.\n\n**Row 2 (Year 2010):**  Azerbaijan's (AZE) SDG index score in 2010 rose slightly to 68.6, maintaining a perfect score on Goal 1 (No Poverty) while showing some improvement in Goal 3 (Good Health and Well-being) to 61.8, but a decrease in Goal 2 (Zero Hunger) to 56.3. Goal 14 (Life Below Water) remained at 0. This indicates continued success in poverty eradication but inconsistent progress in other SDGs.\n\n**Row 3 (Year 2008):**  The 2008 data for Azerbaijan (AZE) shows an SDG index score of 67.9, again with a perfect 100 on Goal 1 (No Poverty), and scores ranging from a low of 0 for Goal 14 (Life Below Water) to highs in the 70s and 80s for other goals like Goal 8 (Decent Work and Economic Growth) and Goal 13 (Climate Action).  The relatively consistent high score in Goal 1 suggests a continued focus on poverty reduction.\n\n**Row 4 (Year 2006):** In 2006, Azerbaijan (AZE) had an SDG index score of 67.2,  achieving a perfect score of 100 in Goal 1 (No Poverty),  similar to other years, but relatively lower scores in other goals, including Goal 6 (Clean Water and Sanitation) at 56.9 and Goal 14 (Life Below Water) remaining at 0. This highlights a consistent strength in poverty reduction but persistent weaknesses in other key areas.\n\n**Row 5 (Year 2009):** Azerbaijan (AZE) in 2009 registered an SDG index score of 68.3,  maintaining a perfect 100 score on Goal 1 (No Poverty), with Goal 9 (Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure) showing a slight improvement compared to previous years, while Goal 14 (Life Below Water) remained at 0.  The data points to continued focus and success in poverty alleviation but limited progress in other sustainable development goals."
