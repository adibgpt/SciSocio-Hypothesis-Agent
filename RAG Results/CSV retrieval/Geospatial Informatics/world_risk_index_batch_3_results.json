        "response": "Here's an analysis of the provided data, following the requested format:\n\n\n**Madagaskar (2011):**  In 2011, Madagaskar exhibited a very high Water Risk Index (WRI) of 14.46, coupled with very high exposure (20.68) and very high vulnerability (69.91), primarily driven by very high susceptibility (67.51), significantly high lack of coping capabilities (85.65), and moderate lack of adaptive capacities (56.57).  This suggests a high level of risk due to a combination of environmental stress and limited capacity to respond.\n\n**Brunei Darussalam (2011):** In 2011, Brunei Darussalam showed a very high Water Risk Index (WRI) of 14.08 and very high exposure (36.28), despite having low vulnerability (38.83), resulting from very low susceptibility (13.48), moderate lack of coping capabilities (66.06), and low lack of adaptive capacities (36.93). This indicates that while the environmental stress is high, the country's capacity to adapt and cope reduces overall vulnerability.\n\n**Afghanistan (2011):**  In 2011, Afghanistan displayed a very high Water Risk Index (WRI) of 14.06, along with high exposure (18.45) and very high vulnerability (76.19). This high vulnerability stemmed from very high susceptibility (61.09), extremely high lack of coping capabilities (93.94), and high lack of adaptive capacities (73.55). This highlights a critical situation of high risk due to environmental pressures and severely limited adaptive capacity.\n\n**Nicaragua (2011):** In 2011, Nicaragua registered a very high Water Risk Index (WRI) of 15.74 and very high exposure (27.64), resulting in high vulnerability (56.94). This vulnerability was characterized by high susceptibility (41.23), very high lack of coping capabilities (83.0), and moderate lack of adaptive capacities (46.59). This suggests a substantial risk stemming from environmental stress and limited response capabilities.\n\n**Papua New Guinea (2011):** In 2011, Papua New Guinea had a very high Water Risk Index (WRI) of 15.45 and very high exposure (23.26), leading to very high vulnerability (66.41). This vulnerability was influenced by very high susceptibility (50.04), very high lack of coping capabilities (84.83), and high lack of adaptive capacities (64.36). This indicates a high risk profile due to significant environmental pressures and limited capacity to manage them."
