        "response": "Here's an analysis of the provided data, presented as requested:\n\n\n**Sudan (2011):**  In Sudan in 2011, a high Water Risk Index (WRI) of 9.25, coupled with medium exposure (13.71) and very high vulnerability (67.44) driven by very high susceptibility (51.62), a significant lack of coping capabilities (90.9), and a substantial lack of adaptive capacities (59.8), indicates a highly precarious situation.  This suggests a high risk of water-related disasters and limited resilience to such events.\n\n**Liberia (2011):** Liberia in 2011 exhibited a high Water Risk Index (WRI) of 9.2, along with medium exposure (12.71) and extremely high vulnerability (72.33) due to very high susceptibility (67.59), high lack of coping capabilities (86.37), and a notable lack of adaptive capacities (63.02).  This points to a severely vulnerable situation with respect to water resources.\n\n**Nigeria (2011):** Nigeria\u2019s 2011 data reveals a high WRI of 9.03, medium exposure (13.41), and very high vulnerability (67.37) stemming from very high susceptibility (54.94),  high lack of coping capabilities (86.93), and a considerable lack of adaptive capacities (60.24). Similar to Liberia and Sudan, Nigeria shows a very high level of vulnerability to water-related risks.\n\n**Suriname (2011):**  In Suriname during 2011, a high WRI of 9.25, combined with very high exposure (19.52), resulted in a moderate vulnerability (47.4) characterized by medium susceptibility (28.84), high lack of coping capabilities (73.82), and moderate lack of adaptive capacities (39.53).  Despite the high WRI and exposure, Suriname's vulnerability is lower than the other countries likely due to comparatively better coping and adaptive capacities.\n\n**Ghana (2011):**  Ghana in 2011 had a high WRI of 9.35, high exposure (15.67), and high vulnerability (59.66) resulting from high susceptibility (48.25), high lack of coping capabilities (77.1), and moderate lack of adaptive capacities (53.63).  While showing high vulnerability, Ghana's situation is less critical than those of Sudan, Liberia, and Nigeria."
