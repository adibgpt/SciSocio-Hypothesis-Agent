        "response": "Here's an analysis of the provided data, presented as requested:\n\n\n**Row 1 (CPV):**  Cabo Verde (CPV), located in Sub-Saharan Africa, achieved an overall score of 68.84, with individual goal scores ranging from a high of 97.15 (Goal 13) to a low of 41.02 (Goal 9).  This suggests a strong performance in areas like Goal 13, potentially related to climate action, while areas like Goal 9 (Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure) require more attention.  The relatively high scores in Goals 1, 3, 4, 5, 11, 12, and 16 indicate strengths in various sustainable development areas.\n\n\n**Row 2 (IRN):** Iran, Islamic Republic of (IRN), situated in the MENA region, received an overall score of 69.09.  While showing high scores in goals 1, 3, 4, and 12, it notably underperformed in Goal 5 (Gender Equality) with a score of 42.95, indicating a significant disparity compared to other goals.  This suggests a need for focused efforts on improving gender equality while building upon existing strengths in other areas.\n\n\n**Row 3 (BOL):** Bolivia (BOL), in the LAC region, obtained an overall score of 68.85.  High scores in Goals 1, 4, and 12 are offset by low scores in Goals 9 and 10, suggesting a strong performance in poverty reduction and sustainable cities, but significant challenges remain in areas like industry and reduced inequalities.  The missing data point for Goal 14 warrants further investigation.\n\n\n**Row 4 (PRY):** Paraguay (PRY), also located in the LAC region, achieved an overall score of 68.84.  Its high scores in Goals 1, 2, 6, and 7 contrast with lower scores in Goals 9, 10, 15, and 16, highlighting success in areas like no poverty and affordable and clean energy, but needing improvements in areas like industry, innovation, and climate action.  Similar to Bolivia, the absence of data for Goal 14 is noteworthy.\n\n\n**Row 5 (OMN):** Oman (OMN), in the MENA region, scored an overall 68.59.  The data shows strong performance in Goals 3, 4, 8, 9, 11, and 14, but missing data points for Goals 1 and 10 hinder a complete assessment. The relatively low score in Goal 13 (Climate Action) suggests a need for greater focus on this area.  The available data indicates strengths in several areas but incomplete information limits a comprehensive evaluation."
