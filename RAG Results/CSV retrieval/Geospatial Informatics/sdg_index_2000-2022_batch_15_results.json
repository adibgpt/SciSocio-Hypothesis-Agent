        "response": "Here's an analysis of the provided data, presented as requested:\n\n\n**Row 1 (Year 2003):**  In Angola (AGO) during 2003, the SDG index score was 47.8, with individual goal scores ranging from a high of 94.2 (Goal 12) to a low of 5.3 (Goal 9).  Goal 1 (55.1) and Goal 8 (63.6) showed relatively strong performance, while Goal 3 (22.9) and Goal 7 (15.2) indicated areas needing significant improvement.  This suggests a mixed performance across the SDGs, with notable strengths in some areas and significant weaknesses in others.\n\n\n**Row 2 (Year 2005):**  Angola (AGO) in 2005 had an SDG index score of 47.8, similar to 2003.  While Goal 8 (63.6) remained consistently strong, several goals showed slight improvements, including Goal 2 (48.4), Goal 3 (23.3), Goal 5 (39.5), and Goal 7 (17.8), suggesting some progress, although Goal 9 (5.3) remained extremely low. The relatively stable SDG index score despite some improvements in individual goals might indicate that the overall development progress was limited.\n\n\n**Row 3 (Year 2001):**  The data for Angola (AGO) in 2001 shows an SDG index score of 47.7, slightly lower than in subsequent years.  Similar to other years, Goal 8 (63.5) performed well, while Goal 9 (5.3) remained consistently low. Goal 3 (21.9) and Goal 7 (13.1) were particularly weak, indicating considerable challenges in health and energy access. The relatively low SDG index score, combined with persistent weaknesses in several goals, highlights the significant development challenges faced by Angola in 2001.\n\n\n**Row 4 (Year 2004):** Angola (AGO) in 2004 achieved an SDG index score of 47.7, comparable to 2001 and 2005.  Goal 1 (55.1) and Goal 8 (63.6) consistently demonstrated relatively strong performance, while Goal 9 (5.3) remained a persistent area of weakness.  Several goals (e.g., Goal 2, Goal 3, Goal 6, Goal 7) showed small improvements compared to previous years, suggesting gradual, though limited, progress across multiple SDGs. The consistency in the SDG index score over time suggests that the overall development trajectory was relatively stagnant.\n\n\n**Row 5 (Year 2002):** In Angola (AGO) during 2002, the SDG index score was 47.4, slightly lower than the following years.  Goal 8 (63.6) maintained its strong performance, while Goal 9 (5.3) remained a significant challenge.  Goals 2, 3, 6, and 7 showed moderate scores, indicating areas requiring further attention. The slightly lower SDG index score compared to subsequent years suggests that the country might have experienced a slight setback in its overall development progress in 2002."
