        "response": "Here's an analysis of the provided data, presented as requested:\n\n\n**Row 1 (Year 2007):**  In 2007, Albania (country code ALB) achieved an SDG index score of 66.8, indicating a relatively moderate performance across the Sustainable Development Goals.  Specifically,  Goal 1 (No Poverty) scored exceptionally high at 96.4, while Goal 2 (Zero Hunger) scored considerably lower at 45.6, highlighting a disparity in progress between these two areas. Other goals showed varied performances, with Goal 10 (Reduced Inequalities) scoring highly at 88.1, and Goal 9 (Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure) scoring poorly at 19.6, suggesting a need for improvement in industrial development.  This suggests a need for balanced development strategies to address the significant gap between extremely high performance in some areas and low performance in others.\n\n**Row 2 (Year 2010):** In 2010, Albania (ALB) saw its SDG index score improve to 69.2, reflecting overall progress. While Goal 1 (No Poverty) remained consistently high at 96.4, Goal 2 (Zero Hunger) showed improvement, rising to 49.4.  Goals 3 (Good Health and Well-being), 7 (Affordable and Clean Energy), and 15 (Life on Land) all showed notable increases compared to 2007, suggesting advancements in these sectors.  The consistent high scores for Goal 10 (Reduced Inequalities) and relatively low scores for Goal 9 (Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure) persisted. This indicates continued progress but also the need for focused investment in industrial development to achieve more balanced growth.\n\n**Row 3 (Year 2008):** In 2008, Albania (ALB) had an SDG index score of 67.5, showing a slight improvement from 2007.  Goal 1 (No Poverty) again scored exceptionally high at 96.4, while Goal 2 (Zero Hunger) showed a modest increase to 48.1.  Several goals demonstrated modest progress, with increases observed in Goals 4 (Quality Education), 7 (Affordable and Clean Energy), and 8 (Decent Work and Economic Growth).  Goal 9 (Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure) remained comparatively low at 21.3, suggesting ongoing challenges in this area. This highlights consistent strong performance in poverty reduction, but continued underperformance in industrial development.\n\n**Row 4 (Year 2009):**  Albania (ALB) achieved an SDG index score of 68 in 2009, indicating continued, albeit slow, progress.  Goal 1 (No Poverty) remained exceptionally high (96.4), while Goal 2 (Zero Hunger) fluctuated slightly around 47.3.  Several goals demonstrated minor improvements or stagnation compared to 2008, showing a relatively stable performance across multiple sectors. Goal 9 (Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure) showed a slight improvement to 24, but remained a relative weakness.  The data suggests a need for more substantial interventions to accelerate progress in specific areas.\n\n**Row 5 (Year 2011):** In 2011, Albania (ALB) reached an SDG index score of 69.6, representing the highest score among the years provided.  Goal 1 (No Poverty) slightly decreased to 96.3, maintaining its high performance. Goal 2 (Zero Hunger) continued its upward trend, reaching 49.7. Several goals showed improvements, particularly Goals 3 (Good Health and Well-being), 4 (Quality Education), and 15 (Life on Land). Goal 9 (Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure) continued to improve, reaching 26.6.  This shows a positive trajectory, but persistent challenges in certain areas remain."
