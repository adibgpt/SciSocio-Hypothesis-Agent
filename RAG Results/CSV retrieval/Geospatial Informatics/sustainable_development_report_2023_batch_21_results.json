        "response": "Here's an analysis of the provided data, presented as requested.  Note that some Goal scores are missing; this will be reflected in the descriptions.\n\n\n**Bangladesh (BGD):**  Bangladesh, located in East & South Asia, achieved an overall score of 65.91,  with individual goal scores ranging from a high of 96.33 (Goal 13) to a low of 40.99 (Goal 9).  Goals 1, 4, 8, and 10 showed relatively strong performance (above 74), while Goals 7, 9, 11, 15, and 17 exhibited lower scores (below 60).  This suggests a varied level of progress across the different Sustainable Development Goals.\n\n\n**Nicaragua (NIC):**  Nicaragua, situated in the LAC region, received an overall score of 64.80.  While scores for Goals 3, 5, 11, 12, and 13 were relatively high (above 73), Goal 10 shows significantly weaker performance (23.66).  This indicates a potential imbalance in the country's progress toward the SDGs, with some areas excelling while others lag considerably.\n\n\n**Iraq (IRQ):** Iraq, in the MENA region, obtained an overall score of 64.79.  Several goal scores are unavailable, hindering a comprehensive assessment.  However, observable scores show a mix of performance across goals, with Goal 10 standing out with a high score of 91.50 and Goals 5, 9, and 15 registering lower scores.  Further data is needed for a complete analysis.\n\n\n**Cambodia (KHM):** Cambodia, also in East & South Asia, had an overall score of 64.84.  Similar to Iraq, some goal scores are missing.  Among the available data, Goal 12 shows high performance (93.60), while Goals 9, 15, and 16 show lower scores.  The missing data prevents a complete evaluation of Cambodia\u2019s SDG progress.\n\n\n**Brunei Darussalam (BRN):** Brunei Darussalam, located in East & South Asia, achieved an overall score of 65.71.  Several goal scores are absent.  However, available data reveals a strong performance in Goals 3, 4, 9, and 11 (all above 60), contrasted by considerably lower scores in Goals 13 and 14.  The missing data limits a thorough understanding of Brunei Darussalam's SDG progress."
