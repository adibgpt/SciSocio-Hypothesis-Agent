        "response": "Here's an analysis of the provided data, presented as requested:\n\n\n**Indien (India):**  In 2011, India had a Water Risk Index (WRI) of 7.68 (Medium category),  an exposure score of 12.68 (Medium category), high vulnerability (60.55, High category), high susceptibility (45.3, High category), a significant lack of coping capabilities (80.11), and a moderate lack of adaptive capacities (56.24).  This suggests that despite a moderate WRI and exposure, India faced a high risk due to considerable vulnerabilities stemming from limited coping and adaptive capacities.\n\n**Peru:** In 2011, Peru exhibited a WRI of 7.24 (Medium category), high exposure (15.08, High category), medium vulnerability (47.99, Medium category), medium susceptibility (31.75, Medium category), a substantial lack of coping capabilities (74.86), and a relatively lower lack of adaptive capacities (37.36) compared to other regions.  Although exposure was high, Peru's overall risk was moderated by lower vulnerability and susceptibility compared to other countries in the dataset.\n\n**Tadschikistan (Tajikistan):**  In 2011, Tajikistan showed a WRI of 7.47 (Medium category),  medium exposure (13.56, Medium category), high vulnerability (55.11, High category), high susceptibility (37.44, High category), a considerable lack of coping capabilities (75.62), and a moderate lack of adaptive capacities (52.28). Similar to India, Tajikistan's moderate WRI and exposure were overshadowed by high vulnerability and susceptibility, indicating a substantial water risk.\n\n**Swasiland (Eswatini):** In 2011, Eswatini presented a WRI of 7.37 (Medium category), medium exposure (11.98, Medium category), high vulnerability (61.56, High category), high susceptibility (48.56, High category), a very high lack of coping capabilities (83.1), and a moderate lack of adaptive capacities (53.02).  Eswatini's water risk profile, like India and Tajikistan, was characterized by high vulnerability and susceptibility despite moderate WRI and exposure scores.\n\n**Uganda:** In 2011, Uganda recorded a WRI of 7.57 (Medium category), low exposure (11.68, Low category), very high vulnerability (64.87, Very High category), very high susceptibility (54.8, Very High category), the highest lack of coping capabilities (86.94) among the listed countries, and a moderate lack of adaptive capacities (52.86).  Uganda's exceptionally high vulnerability and susceptibility, coupled with limited coping capabilities, resulted in a significant water risk despite its relatively low exposure."
