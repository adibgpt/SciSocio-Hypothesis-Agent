        "response": "Here's an analysis of the provided data, presented as requested:\n\n\n**Mongolei (2011):**  In 2011, Mongolia (Region: Mongolei) exhibited very low exposure (6.99) and a very low Water Risk Index (WRI) of 3.43, despite a medium vulnerability score (49.13) driven by high susceptibility (35.15), significantly high lack of coping capabilities (67.53), and considerable lack of adaptive capacities (44.7).  This suggests that while Mongolia faced limited exposure to water-related risks, its vulnerability was substantial due to significant weaknesses in coping and adaptive mechanisms.\n\n\n**\u00d6sterreich (2011):** In 2011, Austria (Region: \u00d6sterreich) showed medium exposure (13.4) to water-related risks, yet maintained a very low WRI (3.41) and very low vulnerability (25.48), reflecting very low susceptibility (13.85), moderate lack of coping capabilities (37.52), and moderate lack of adaptive capacities (25.06). This indicates that Austria experienced a moderate level of exposure but possessed strong coping and adaptive capacities, resulting in low overall vulnerability.\n\n\n**Zypern (2011):** Cyprus (Region: Zypern) in 2011 had low exposure (10.62) to water-related risks and a very low WRI (3.46), alongside very low vulnerability (32.63) characterized by very low susceptibility (15.1), moderate lack of coping capabilities (50.09), and moderate lack of adaptive capacities (32.69).  This implies that despite moderate deficiencies in coping and adaptive capacities, Cyprus's low exposure and low susceptibility resulted in low overall vulnerability.\n\n\n**Polen (2011):** Poland (Region: Polen) in 2011 demonstrated very low exposure (9.6) and a very low WRI (3.42), with low vulnerability (35.62) stemming from low susceptibility (17.27), but notable lack of coping capabilities (56.89) and moderate lack of adaptive capacities (32.72).  This suggests that while Poland's exposure was minimal, its vulnerability was somewhat elevated due to limitations in coping and adaptive capacities.\n\n\n**Slowakei (2011):** Slovakia (Region: Slowakei) in 2011 presented low exposure (10.18) and a very low WRI (3.38), resulting in very low vulnerability (33.22) due to very low susceptibility (14.43), significant lack of coping capabilities (54.8), and moderate lack of adaptive capacities (30.43).  Similar to Cyprus, Slovakia's low exposure and susceptibility kept its overall vulnerability low despite moderate challenges in coping and adaptation."
