        "response": "Here's an analysis of the provided data, presented as requested:\n\n\n**Vietnam (2013):**  In Vietnam in 2013, the Water Risk Index (WRI) was 12.81 (Very High category),  reflecting high exposure (25.35, Very High), medium vulnerability (50.53, Medium category) driven by  medium susceptibility (28.08, Medium category),  a significant lack of coping capabilities (76.71), and a moderate lack of adaptive capacities (46.8).  This suggests that despite high exposure, Vietnam's vulnerability is largely driven by limited adaptive and coping capacities.\n\n**Chile (2013):** In Chile in 2013, a very high exposure to water risk (30.95, Very High category) resulted in a very high Water Risk Index (WRI) of 12.28 (Very High category), yet low vulnerability (39.66, Low category) due to low susceptibility (20.71, Low category), relatively lower lack of coping capabilities (58.65), and a similar lack of adaptive capacities (39.63). This indicates that despite high exposure, Chile possesses relatively strong adaptive and coping mechanisms.\n\n\n**Jamaica (2013):** Jamaica in 2013 exhibited a very high Water Risk Index (WRI) of 12.15 (Very High category) due to very high exposure (25.82, Very High category) and medium vulnerability (47.07, Medium category). This medium vulnerability stemmed from medium susceptibility (27.1, Medium category), high lack of coping capabilities (72.09), and moderate lack of adaptive capacities (42.01).  Similar to Vietnam, Jamaica's vulnerability is primarily due to limitations in coping and adaptive capacities, despite high exposure.\n\n**Haiti (2013):** Haiti in 2013 faced a very high Water Risk Index (WRI) of 11.88 (Very High category) stemming from high exposure (16.26, High category) and extremely high vulnerability (73.05, Very High category). This extremely high vulnerability was characterized by very high susceptibility (61.64, Very High category), extremely high lack of coping capabilities (89.63), and high lack of adaptive capacities (67.88).  Haiti's high WRI is a consequence of both exposure and significantly deficient coping and adaptive capabilities.\n\n**Gambia (2013):** In The Gambia in 2013, a very high Water Risk Index (WRI) of 11.71 (Very High category) resulted from very high exposure (19.29, Very High category) and high vulnerability (60.69, High category). This high vulnerability arose from high susceptibility (42.31, High category), very high lack of coping capabilities (82.39), and high lack of adaptive capacities (57.38).  The Gambia, like Haiti, exhibits a high WRI due to a combination of high exposure and severely limited coping and adaptive capacities."
