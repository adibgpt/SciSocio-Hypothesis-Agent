        "response": "Here's an analysis of the provided data, presented as requested:\n\n\n**Bangladesh (2011):**  In Bangladesh in 2011, very high exposure (27.52) combined with high susceptibility (44.96) and extremely low coping (86.49) and adaptive capacities (58.77) resulted in a very high vulnerability score (63.41) and a very high overall Water Risk Index (WRI) of 17.45.  This indicates a highly vulnerable nation facing significant water-related risks.\n\n**Costa Rica (2011):** Costa Rica in 2011 experienced very high exposure to water risks (42.39), yet despite this,  relatively low susceptibility (21.96) and moderate lack of coping (63.39) and adaptive capacities (33.14) led to a low vulnerability score (39.5) and a very high WRI (16.74). This suggests that despite high exposure, effective coping mechanisms and adaptive capacities mitigate the overall risk.\n\n**Cambodia (2011):**  Cambodia in 2011 showed very high exposure (26.66) and high susceptibility (48.28), coupled with extremely low coping (86.43) and adaptive capacities (51.81), resulting in high vulnerability (62.18) and a very high WRI (16.58). This highlights a substantial vulnerability despite slightly lower exposure than Bangladesh.\n\n**Timor-Leste (2011):** Timor-Leste in 2011 faced very high exposure (25.97) and very high susceptibility (52.42), with extremely low coping (89.16) and adaptive capacities (59.93), leading to very high vulnerability (67.17) and a very high WRI (17.45). This demonstrates an extremely precarious situation with high risk across all indicators.\n\n**El Salvador (2011):** In El Salvador during 2011, very high exposure (32.18) contributed to medium susceptibility (30.55) and vulnerability (51.24),  influenced by high lack of coping (75.35) and moderate lack of adaptive capacities (47.82). The resulting very high WRI (16.49) indicates a considerable water risk, although lower than those countries with very high vulnerability scores."
