        "response": "Here's an analysis of the provided data, following the requested format.  Note that this data appears to represent SDG index scores for Angola and Argentina across several years.  There's no CSV file structure, just a series of rows presented in a key-value pair format.\n\n\n**Row 1:**  country_code: AGO, country: Angola, year: 2021, sdg_index_score: 51, goal_1_score: 32.8, goal_2_score: 54.9, goal_3_score: 35.2, goal_4_score: 44.6, goal_5_score: 49.7, goal_6_score: 54.3, goal_7_score: 43.6, goal_8_score: 58.8, goal_9_score: 13.7, goal_10_score: 16.5, goal_11_score: 43.2, goal_12_score: 94.1, goal_13_score: 96.3, goal_14_score: 67.4, goal_15_score: 66.3, goal_16_score: 44.4, goal_17_score: 50.8.
