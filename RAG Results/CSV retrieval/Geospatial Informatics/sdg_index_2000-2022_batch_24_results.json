        "response": "Here's an analysis of the provided data, presented as requested.  Note that the data is presented as a series of rows, not a CSV file, but the analysis follows the instructions.\n\n\n**Row 1 (Year 2003):**  In 2003, Armenia (ARM) achieved an SDG index score of 67.8, with notable scores including 88.8 for Goal 1, 50 for Goal 2, 65.6 for Goal 3, and 20.2 for Goal 9, indicating strong performance in some areas (like Goal 1) and weaker performance in others (like Goal 9).  The relatively high scores in Goals 11, 12, and 13 suggest progress in sustainable cities, responsible consumption, and climate action, respectively, while a score of 0 for Goal 14 highlights a significant challenge in the area of life below water.  Overall, Armenia showed a mixed performance across the SDGs in 2003.\n\n**Row 2 (Year 2000):**  Armenia's 2000 data reveals an SDG index score of 66.9, slightly lower than in 2003.  Goal 1 again scored highly (88.8), while Goal 2 (49.4) and Goal 9 (19.1) remained relatively low.  Similar to 2003, high scores were observed in Goals 11, 12, and 13, and a score of 0 persisted for Goal 14. This suggests consistent strengths and weaknesses across the years, with limited improvement in several key areas.\n\n\n**Row 3 (Year 2004):** In 2004, Armenia's SDG index score was 67.1, showing a small increase compared to 2000. Goal 2 showed improvement (55.1), while Goal 1 remained consistently high (88.8). Goal 6 and Goal 10 showed decreases, indicating potential setbacks.  Despite the slight overall improvement, the persistently low score for Goal 14 and the relatively low scores for several other goals highlight ongoing challenges.\n\n\n**Row 4 (Year 2002):** Armenia's SDG index score in 2002 reached 67.4, reflecting a moderate level of progress across the SDGs.  Goal 1 remained consistently high (88.8), while Goal 2 showed improvement (50.4) over the previous years. Goal 9 (19.4) and Goal 14 (0) remained areas of significant concern.  Scores in Goals 11, 12 and 13 remained high, suggesting continued progress in those areas.\n\n\n**Row 5 (Year 2001):**  In 2001, Armenia recorded an SDG index score of 67.2. Goal 1 maintained its high score (88.8), while Goal 2 improved to 52.2. Goal 9 remained relatively low (19.4), and Goal 14 again scored 0.   The consistent high scores in Goals 11, 12, and 13 continue to indicate sustained progress in sustainable cities, responsible consumption and climate action.\n\n\n\nOverall Summary: The data shows relatively stable SDG index scores for Armenia between 2000 and 2004, ranging from 66.9 to 67.8.  Goal 1 consistently scored highly, while Goal 9 and Goal 14 consistently scored very low, highlighting persistent challenges in these areas.  Goals 11, 12, and 13 show consistent strong performance.  Goal 2 shows some improvement over the period.  More data would be needed to draw definitive conclusions about trends and the effectiveness of policies."
