        "response": "Here's an analysis of the provided data, presented as requested:\n\n**Row 1:**  In 2020, Afghanistan (AFG) achieved an SDG index score of 47.3, indicating a relatively low performance across the Sustainable Development Goals.  Specifically, Goal 1 (No Poverty) scored 27.9, Goal 2 (Zero Hunger) scored 46, Goal 3 (Good Health and Well-being) scored 37.6, Goal 4 (Quality Education) scored 42, Goal 5 (Gender Equality) scored 30.2, Goal 6 (Clean Water and Sanitation) scored 50.4, Goal 7 (Affordable and Clean Energy) scored 35.9, Goal 8 (Decent Work and Economic Growth) scored 41.1, Goal 9 (Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure) scored a low 9.8, Goal 10 (Reduced Inequalities) scored 0, Goal 11 (Sustainable Cities and Communities) scored 30.2, Goal 12 (Responsible Consumption and Production) scored a high 96.7, Goal 13 (Climate Action) scored a high 99, Goal 14 (Life Below Water) scored 0, Goal 15 (Life On Land) scored 73.2, Goal 16 (Peace, Justice, and Strong Institutions) scored 45.3, and Goal 17 (Partnerships for the Goals) scored 44.1.  This suggests significant challenges in poverty reduction, economic growth, and several other key areas, while surprisingly high scores in responsible consumption and climate action might indicate data reporting inconsistencies or other factors.\n\n**Row 2:** In 2001, Albania (ALB) had an SDG index score of 65.9, reflecting a considerably higher level of achievement compared to Afghanistan in the same year.  Notable scores included 96.4 for Goal 1 (No Poverty), 46.2 for Goal 2 (Zero Hunger), 74.7 for Goal 3 (Good Health and Well-being), 82.8 for Goal 4 (Quality Education), 37.3 for Goal 5 (Gender Equality), 69 for Goal 6 (Clean Water and Sanitation), 73.4 for Goal 7 (Affordable and Clean Energy), 61.5 for Goal 8 (Decent Work and Economic Growth), 17.6 for Goal 9 (Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure), 84.4 for Goal 10 (Reduced Inequalities), 74.6 for Goal 11 (Sustainable Cities and Communities), 84.4 for Goal 12 (Responsible Consumption and Production), 89.9 for Goal 13 (Climate Action), 36 for Goal 14 (Life Below Water), 66.5 for Goal 15 (Life On Land), 65.4 for Goal 16 (Peace, Justice, and Strong Institutions), and 60 for Goal 17 (Partnerships for the Goals).  Albania's relatively strong performance across multiple goals highlights a more developed social and economic infrastructure compared to Afghanistan.\n\n**Row 3:** In 2022, Afghanistan (AFG) showed an SDG index score of 49, a slight improvement from 2020 but still indicating low overall progress.  Goal 1 (No Poverty) saw a significant drop to 12.4, while Goal 2 (Zero Hunger) remained relatively stable at 46.9. Other goals showed minor changes, with Goal 11 (Sustainable Cities and Communities) decreasing to 24.5. The consistent high scores in Goals 12 and 13 remain, while low scores in Goals 9, 10 and 14 persist. This suggests that despite a small overall improvement, significant challenges persist, particularly in poverty reduction and economic development.\n\n**Row 4:** In 2021, Afghanistan (AFG) registered an SDG index score of 46.3, a decline from 2020.  Similar to 2022, Goal 1 (No Poverty) declined to 20, and other goals showed minor fluctuations.  Goals 12 and 13 again show high scores. The data suggests a worsening situation in Afghanistan across various development goals in 2021 compared to 2020,  particularly concerning poverty reduction.\n\n**Row 5:**  In 2000, Albania (ALB) had an SDG index score of 65.9, similar to its 2001 score.  The scores for most goals are very close to those of 2001, suggesting relative stability across the goals during that period. The consistent performance across multiple goals reinforces the observation of a relatively well-developed social and economic infrastructure in Albania during that time."
