        "response": "Here's an analysis of the provided data, presented as requested.  Note that some goal scores are missing for some countries.\n\n**China (CHN):**  China, located in East & South Asia, achieved an overall score of 72.008, comprised of individual goal scores ranging from a high of 99.531 (Goal 4) to a low of 34.930 (Goal 10).  This suggests strong performance in some areas, but significant room for improvement in others, particularly Goal 10.\n\n**Peru (PER):** Peru, situated in the LAC region, received an overall score of 71.659, with goal scores varying between 93.512 (Goal 13) and 33.761 (Goal 10).  Similar to China, Peru shows uneven performance across the different goals, excelling in Goal 13 but needing improvement in Goal 10.\n\n**Singapore (SGP):** Singapore, also in East & South Asia, obtained an overall score of 71.777.  Missing data for Goals 1 and 10 prevents a complete analysis, but the available scores reveal strong performance in Goal 9 (91.356) and weaker performance in Goal 15 (26.478).  Further data is needed for a comprehensive assessment.\n\n**Bhutan (BTN):** Bhutan, located in East & South Asia, achieved an overall score of 72.339, demonstrating a relatively balanced performance across goals, though with scores ranging from 89.946 (Goal 13) to 42.480 (Goal 9).  Goal 14's missing data limits the full picture of Bhutan's performance.\n\n**Dominican Republic (DOM):** The Dominican Republic, in the LAC region, scored 72.135 overall.  Its goal scores varied from 95.927 (Goal 1) to 46.753 (Goal 9), indicating areas of strength and weakness.  Goal 1 shows exceptionally high performance compared to other goals."
