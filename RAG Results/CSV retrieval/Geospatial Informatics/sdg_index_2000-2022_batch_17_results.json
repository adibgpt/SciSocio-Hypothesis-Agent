        "response": "Here's an analysis of the provided data, presented as requested:\n\n\n**Row 1 (Year 2015):**  In 2015, Angola (AGO) achieved an SDG index score of 52.2, indicating a moderate level of progress across all Sustainable Development Goals.  Specifically, Angola scored 49.7 on Goal 1 (No Poverty), 58.4 on Goal 2 (Zero Hunger), 33.1 on Goal 3 (Good Health and Well-being), 38.5 on Goal 4 (Quality Education), 53.6 on Goal 5 (Gender Equality), 52.4 on Goal 6 (Clean Water and Sanitation), 34.1 on Goal 7 (Affordable and Clean Energy), 58.9 on Goal 8 (Decent Work and Economic Growth), 12.8 on Goal 9 (Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure), 39.4 on Goal 10 (Reduced Inequalities), 45.4 on Goal 11 (Sustainable Cities and Communities), 93.7 on Goal 12 (Responsible Consumption and Production), 91.7 on Goal 13 (Climate Action), 69.7 on Goal 14 (Life Below Water), 67.1 on Goal 15 (Life On Land), 42.2 on Goal 16 (Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions), and 46.4 on Goal 17 (Partnerships for the Goals).  This suggests a relatively strong performance in areas like responsible consumption and climate action, but significant room for improvement in areas such as health, education, and infrastructure.\n\n\n**Row 2 (Year 2012):** In 2012, Angola (AGO) had an SDG index score of 52.4, slightly higher than in 2015.  The individual goal scores show some variation compared to 2015, with Goal 1 (No Poverty) at 54.5, Goal 2 (Zero Hunger) at 55.1, Goal 3 (Good Health and Well-being) at 30.7, Goal 4 (Quality Education) at 36.1, Goal 5 (Gender Equality) at 52.5, Goal 6 (Clean Water and Sanitation) at 50.8, Goal 7 (Affordable and Clean Energy) at 26.4, Goal 8 (Decent Work and Economic Growth) at 61.3, Goal 9 (Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure) at 12, Goal 10 (Reduced Inequalities) at 39.4, Goal 11 (Sustainable Cities and Communities) at 48.4, Goal 12 (Responsible Consumption and Production) at 93.7, Goal 13 (Climate Action) at 91.9, Goal 14 (Life Below Water) at 67.5, Goal 15 (Life On Land) at 67.1, Goal 16 (Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions) at 41.8, and Goal 17 (Partnerships for the Goals) at a notably high 60.8.  Similar to 2015, strong performance in responsible consumption and climate action is evident, while other areas require attention.\n\n\n**Row 3 (Year 2013):**  Angola's (AGO) SDG index score rose slightly to 53.1 in 2013. The individual goal scores show continued variation, with Goal 1 at 53.1, Goal 2 at 57.6, Goal 3 at 31.1, Goal 4 at 36.1, Goal 5 at 52.3, Goal 6 at 51.3, Goal 7 at 31.8, Goal 8 at 60.8, Goal 9 at 13.3, Goal 10 at 39.4, Goal 11 at 48.1, Goal 12 at 93.5, Goal 13 at 91.8, Goal 14 at 66.8, Goal 15 at 67.1, Goal 16 at 45.5, and Goal 17 at 62.9.  The trend of strong performance in responsible consumption and climate action continues,  while progress in other areas appears inconsistent.\n\n\n**Row 4 (Year 2014):** In 2014, Angola (AGO) experienced a slight dip in its SDG index score to 52.  Goal scores show some fluctuation, with notable decreases in Goal 7 (Affordable and Clean Energy) and Goal 13 (Climate Action).  The overall pattern of relatively strong performance in Goals 12 and 13 and weaker performance in Goals 3, 4, 7, and 9 remains consistent with previous years.\n\n\n**Row 5 (Year 2011):** In 2011, Angola (AGO) had an SDG index score of 52.5.  The data reveals a relatively high score for Goal 8 (Decent Work and Economic Growth) at 61.7 and a comparatively low score for Goal 9 (Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure) at 5.7.  This highlights a potential imbalance in economic development, with strong employment figures but significant lags in infrastructure development.  The patterns of relatively strong performance in Goals 12 and 13 and weaker performance in several other goals are consistent with other years."
