        "response": "Here's an analysis of the provided data, presented as requested:\n\n**Row 1:**  In 2022, Albania (country code ALB) achieved an SDG index score of 73.5, indicating a moderate level of progress across the Sustainable Development Goals.  This score is comprised of individual goal scores, with notable highs in Goal 1 (98.6, likely related to poverty reduction) and Goal 13 (90.6, climate action), and lower scores in Goal 2 (59.3, zero hunger) and Goal 9 (43.6, industry, innovation, and infrastructure).  Albania's relatively high overall score suggests progress but highlights areas needing further attention.\n\n**Row 2:** In 2003, Algeria (country code DZA) had an SDG index score of 66.6, showcasing less progress compared to Albania in 2022.  The data shows high scores in Goal 10 (97, reduced inequalities) and Goal 12 (89.5, responsible consumption and production), while considerably lower scores were observed in Goal 2 (48.1, zero hunger) and Goal 5 (33.2, gender equality).  Algeria's score suggests a need for improvement across several SDGs.\n\n**Row 3:**  Algeria's 2000 SDG index score was 65.3, slightly lower than its 2003 score.  Similar to 2003, Goal 10 (97, reduced inequalities) and Goal 12 (89.8, responsible consumption and production) showed strong performance, while Goal 2 (48.7, zero hunger) and Goal 5 (29.6, gender equality) remained relatively low.  The consistent high scores in Goals 10 and 12 suggest consistent strength in these areas, while persistent weakness in Goals 2 and 5 are evident.\n\n**Row 4:**  Algeria's 2001 SDG index score (66.1) shows a slight improvement compared to 2000.  While Goal 10 (97, reduced inequalities) and Goal 12 (89.8, responsible consumption and production) remain consistently high, Goal 2 (51.2, zero hunger) and Goal 5 (30.4, gender equality) show modest improvement from the previous year.  The data indicates slow but steady progress in some areas.\n\n**Row 5:**  In 2002, Algeria (DZA) registered an SDG index score of 66, a minor decrease from 2001. The data reveals the persistent strength in Goal 10 (97, reduced inequalities) and Goal 12 (89.3, responsible consumption and production), while Goal 2 (45.6, zero hunger) and Goal 5 (32.5, gender equality) show fluctuation in performance.  The relatively stable scores across years for several goals point to consistent policy focus in certain areas."
