        "response": "Here's an analysis of the provided data, presented as requested:\n\n\n**Row 1 (Year 2010):**  In 2010, Australia (AUS) achieved an SDG index score of 72.2, with particularly high scores in Goal 1 (99.7) and Goal 6 (93.9), indicating strong performance in poverty reduction and clean water and sanitation.  However, scores were considerably lower in Goals 12 (45.1) and 13 (3.3), suggesting challenges in responsible consumption and production and climate action.  Overall, Australia demonstrated a relatively high SDG index score but significant disparities across different goals.\n\n\n**Row 2 (Year 2007):** In 2007, Australia (AUS) had an SDG index score of 71.5.  Similar to 2010,  Goal 1 (99.7) and Goal 6 (93.8) showed strong performance, while Goal 12 (44.7) and Goal 13 (1.9) remained relatively low.  Compared to 2010,  there's a slight decrease in the overall SDG index score and some minor variations in individual goal scores, indicating relatively stable performance across most goals.\n\n\n**Row 3 (Year 2008):**  Australia's (AUS) SDG index score in 2008 was 71.5, mirroring 2007.  Again,  Goal 1 (99.7) and Goal 6 (93.9) exhibited high scores, while Goal 12 (45.2) and Goal 13 (2.2) remained low.  The data shows consistent high performance in some areas and persistent underperformance in others, with minimal change from 2007.\n\n\n**Row 4 (Year 2011):** During 2011, Australia (AUS) achieved an SDG index score of 72.2, similar to 2010.  High scores were maintained in Goal 1 (99.7) and Goal 6 (93.9), while Goal 12 (44.5) and Goal 13 (3.0) continued to lag.  Compared to previous years, there's a slight improvement in the overall SDG index and some individual goal scores, suggesting marginal progress across the board.\n\n\n**Row 5 (Year 2009):**  In 2009, Australia (AUS) recorded an SDG index score of 71.8.  High scores persisted in Goal 1 (99.7) and Goal 6 (93.9), while low scores remained consistent in Goal 12 (45.8) and Goal 13 (2.6).  This year's data shows a slight increase in the overall SDG index score compared to 2008, with moderate changes in several goal scores."
