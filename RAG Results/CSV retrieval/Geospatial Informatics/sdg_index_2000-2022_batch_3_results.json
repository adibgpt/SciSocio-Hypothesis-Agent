        "response": "Here's an analysis of the provided data, presented as requested:\n\n\n**Row 1 (Year 2014):**  In 2014, Afghanistan (AFG) achieved an SDG index score of 40.8, indicating a moderate level of progress across the Sustainable Development Goals.  Specifically, scores included 30.7 for Goal 1 (No Poverty), 44.3 for Goal 2 (Zero Hunger), 30.9 for Goal 3 (Good Health and Well-being), a very low 1.6 for Goal 4 (Quality Education), 21.8 for Goal 5 (Gender Equality), 42.9 for Goal 6 (Clean Water and Sanitation), 31.6 for Goal 7 (Affordable and Clean Energy), 38.7 for Goal 8 (Decent Work and Economic Growth), a low 5.8 for Goal 9 (Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure), 0 for Goal 10 (Reduced Inequalities), 33.6 for Goal 11 (Sustainable Cities and Communities), a high 96.3 for Goal 12 (Responsible Consumption and Production), a very high 99.1 for Goal 13 (Climate Action), 0 for Goal 14 (Life Below Water), 53 for Goal 15 (Life on Land), 45.3 for Goal 16 (Peace, Justice, and Strong Institutions), and 36 for Goal 17 (Partnerships for the Goals). This reveals significant disparities in progress across different SDGs, with particularly low scores in education, inequality, and ocean-related goals.\n\n\n**Row 2 (Year 2010):** In 2010, Afghanistan (AFG) had an SDG index score of 38.8, lower than in 2014, showing less progress across the SDGs.  The individual goal scores were: 28.8 (Goal 1), 43.2 (Goal 2), 31.4 (Goal 3), 1.6 (Goal 4), 21 (Goal 5), 38 (Goal 6), 15.2 (Goal 7), 38.5 (Goal 8), 5.5 (Goal 9), 0 (Goal 10), 29.9 (Goal 11), 96.3 (Goal 12), 99 (Goal 13), 0 (Goal 14), 53 (Goal 15), 43.8 (Goal 16), and 36.6 (Goal 17).  Compared to 2014, progress in Goal 7 (energy) was notably lower in 2010.\n\n\n**Row 3 (Year 2013):**  Afghanistan (AFG)'s SDG index score in 2013 was 39.7, slightly higher than in 2010 but lower than in 2014, indicating some year-to-year fluctuation in overall progress. The scores for each goal were: 31 (Goal 1), 44.2 (Goal 2), 29.6 (Goal 3), 1.6 (Goal 4), 21.3 (Goal 5), 41.6 (Goal 6), 24.5 (Goal 7), 38.5 (Goal 8), 6.6 (Goal 9), 0 (Goal 10), 28.9 (Goal 11), 96 (Goal 12), 99 (Goal 13), 0 (Goal 14), 53 (Goal 15), 44.3 (Goal 16), and 35.6 (Goal 17).  Similar to previous years, Goals 4, 9, 10, and 14 show very little progress.\n\n\n**Row 4 (Year 2012):** In 2012, Afghanistan (AFG) had an SDG index score of 39.7, identical to 2013.  The goal scores were: 30.5 (Goal 1), 44.3 (Goal 2), 30.4 (Goal 3), 1.6 (Goal 4), 21 (Goal 5), 40.4 (Goal 6), 23.9 (Goal 7), 38.5 (Goal 8), 6.5 (Goal 9), 0 (Goal 10), 31.4 (Goal 11), 96.1 (Goal 12), 98.9 (Goal 13), 0 (Goal 14), 53 (Goal 15), 43.5 (Goal 16), and 35.3 (Goal 17).  Again, consistent low scores are observed across several goals.\n\n\n**Row 5 (Year 2011):**  Afghanistan (AFG) registered an SDG index score of 38.4 in 2011, the lowest among the years provided. The individual goal scores were: 27.9 (Goal 1), 42 (Goal 2), 30.6 (Goal 3), 1.6 (Goal 4), 21 (Goal 5), 39.2 (Goal 6), 15.7 (Goal 7), 38.5 (Goal 8), 5.6 (Goal 9), 0 (Goal 10), 25.9 (Goal 11), 96 (Goal 12), 98.8 (Goal 13), 0 (Goal 14), 53 (Goal 15), 43 (Goal 16), and 36.9 (Goal 17).  The low SDG index score reflects consistently low performance across multiple goals.\n\n\n**Summary:** The data shows Afghanistan's SDG progress from 2010 to 2014.  While there is some year-to-year variation, a persistent pattern of low scores emerges for Goals 4 (Quality Education), 9 (Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure), 10 (Reduced Inequalities), and 14 (Life Below Water).  Goals 12 and 13 show consistently high scores, suggesting relative success in responsible consumption and climate action.  Overall, Afghanistan faces significant challenges in achieving the SDGs, particularly in areas related to education, inequality, and sustainable infrastructure."
