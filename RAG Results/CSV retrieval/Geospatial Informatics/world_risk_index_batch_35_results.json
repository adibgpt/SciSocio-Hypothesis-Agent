        "response": "Here's an analysis of the provided data, presented as requested:\n\n\n**Katar (2011):**  In 2011, Katar exhibited very low exposure (0.05), a very low Water Risk Index (WRI) of 0.02, and very low vulnerability (33.18) stemming from very low susceptibility (9.4),  a lack of coping capabilities (52.12), and a lack of adaptive capacities (38.03).  This suggests a low overall risk profile for Katar in 2011 related to water resources.\n\n\n**Tonga (2013):** In 2013, Tonga showed very high exposure (55.27) and a very high WRI (28.23), resulting in medium vulnerability (51.07) due to medium susceptibility (27.72), significantly high lack of coping capabilities (80.56), and a notable lack of adaptive capacities (44.94).  This indicates a substantial vulnerability to water-related risks despite the medium vulnerability classification.\n\n\n**Malta (2011):** In 2011, Malta had very low exposure (2.15) and a very low WRI (0.72), leading to very low vulnerability (33.34) characterized by very low susceptibility (15.21), moderate lack of coping capabilities (50.13), and moderate lack of adaptive capacities (34.67).  Malta demonstrates a low risk profile in 2011, despite having slightly higher coping and adaptive capacity limitations than Katar.\n\n\n**Saudi-Arabien (2011):** In 2011, Saudi Arabia displayed very low exposure (2.91) and a very low WRI (1.26), resulting in low vulnerability (43.3) attributed to low susceptibility (18.26), a high lack of coping capabilities (67.84), and a high lack of adaptive capacities (43.8). Despite low exposure and WRI, the high lack of coping and adaptive capacities contribute to a moderate vulnerability level.\n\n\n**Vanuatu (2013):** In 2013, Vanuatu experienced very high exposure (63.66) and a very high WRI (36.43), leading to high vulnerability (57.23) because of high susceptibility (34.66), very high lack of coping capabilities (81.27), and high lack of adaptive capacities (55.77).  Vanuatu demonstrates a significantly high risk profile in 2013, driven by high exposure and a substantial lack of coping and adaptive capacities."
