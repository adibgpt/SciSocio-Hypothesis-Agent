        "response": "Here's an analysis of the provided data, presented as requested:\n\n\n**Bulgarie (2011):**  In Bulgaria in 2011, the Water Risk Index (WRI) was 4.08, categorized as low, indicating low exposure (11.08) and low vulnerability (36.78), which comprised low susceptibility (17.3), a lack of coping capabilities (57.92), and a lack of adaptive capacities (35.12).  In summary, Bulgaria exhibited relatively low water risk in 2011, although a significant lack of coping capabilities suggests potential vulnerabilities despite low overall scores.\n\n\n**Argentinien (2011):** In Argentina in 2011, a low Water Risk Index (WRI) of 3.77,  was associated with very low exposure (9.71) and low vulnerability (38.8). This vulnerability was made up of medium susceptibility (23.22), a substantial lack of coping capabilities (60.34), and a moderate lack of adaptive capacities (32.85).  In summary, despite low exposure, Argentina showed a notable lack of coping capabilities, contributing to its low but not insignificant overall water risk.\n\n\n**Vereinigte Arabisch Emirate (2011):**  The United Arab Emirates in 2011 had a low Water Risk Index (WRI) of 4.09,  with low exposure (10.48) and low overall vulnerability (38.99).  This vulnerability stemmed from very low susceptibility (10.85), but a high lack of coping capabilities (58.78) and a considerable lack of adaptive capacities (47.35).  In summary, the UAE displayed low water risk despite significant challenges in coping and adaptive capacities, highlighting the importance of these factors even with low exposure and susceptibility.\n\n\n**Kasachstan (2011):**  In Kazakhstan in 2011, the Water Risk Index (WRI) was 4.04 (low), reflecting very low exposure (9.71) and low vulnerability (41.55). This vulnerability was composed of low susceptibility (20.35), but high lack of coping capabilities (60.96) and significant lack of adaptive capacities (43.35).  In summary, Kazakhstan demonstrated low water risk despite substantial limitations in coping and adaptive capacities, mirroring the pattern seen in the UAE.\n\n\n**Uruguay (2011):** In Uruguay in 2011, a low Water Risk Index (WRI) of 3.94 was observed, alongside low exposure (10.84) and low vulnerability (36.35). This low vulnerability resulted from low susceptibility (21.19), a moderate lack of coping capabilities (50.74), and a moderate lack of adaptive capacities (37.13).  In summary, Uruguay exhibited low water risk in 2011, with relatively balanced scores across the vulnerability components."
