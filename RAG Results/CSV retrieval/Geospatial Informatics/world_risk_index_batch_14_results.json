        "response": "Here's an analysis of the provided data, formatted as requested:\n\n\n**Region: Kongo**\n\n1. Column Names and Values: Region: Kongo, WRI: 7.71, Exposure: 12.19, Vulnerability: 63.28, Susceptibility: 50.98, Lack of Coping Capabilities: 87.39, Lack of Adaptive Capacities: 51.45, Year: 2011, Exposure Category: Medium, WRI Category: Medium, Vulnerability Category: High, Susceptibility Category: Very High\n\n2. Descriptive Sentence: In Kongo in 2011, a medium exposure level (12.19) coupled with a medium WRI (7.71) resulted in high vulnerability (63.28) primarily driven by very high susceptibility (50.98), significantly exacerbated by a very high lack of coping (87.39) and a high lack of adaptive capacities (51.45).\n\n3. Summary Statement: Kongo in 2011 showed high vulnerability to a specific risk, despite only medium exposure, indicating significant weaknesses in coping and adaptive capacities.\n\n\n**Region: Niederlande**\n\n1. Column Names and Values: Region: Niederlande, WRI: 7.71, Exposure: 29.24, Vulnerability: 26.37, Susceptibility: 13.99, Lack of Coping Capabilities: 38.71, Lack of Adaptive Capacities: 26.42, Year: 2011, Exposure Category: Very High, WRI Category: Medium, Vulnerability Category: Very Low, Susceptibility Category: Very Low\n\n2. Descriptive Sentence:  Niederlande in 2011 experienced very high exposure (29.24) despite a medium WRI (7.71), yet demonstrated very low vulnerability (26.37) due to very low susceptibility (13.99),  relatively low lack of coping capabilities (38.71), and low lack of adaptive capacities (26.42).\n\n3. Summary Statement:  Niederlande in 2011 had a surprisingly low vulnerability despite very high exposure, suggesting strong coping and adaptive capacities mitigating the impact of the risk.\n\n\n**Region: Pakistan**\n\n1. Column Names and Values: Region: Pakistan, WRI: 7.84, Exposure: 12.27, Vulnerability: 63.84, Susceptibility: 40.33, Lack of Coping Capabilities: 86.61, Lack of Adaptive Capacities: 64.58, Year: 2011, Exposure Category: Medium, WRI Category: High, Vulnerability Category: Very High, Susceptibility Category: High\n\n2. Descriptive Sentence: In Pakistan during 2011, a medium exposure level (12.27) combined with a high WRI (7.84) led to very high vulnerability (63.84), characterized by high susceptibility (40.33), and significantly amplified by a very high lack of coping capabilities (86.61) and a high lack of adaptive capacities (64.58).\n\n3. Summary Statement:  Pakistan in 2011 exhibited very high vulnerability despite only medium exposure, highlighting significant deficiencies in coping and adaptive mechanisms.\n\n\n**Region: Panama**\n\n1. Column Names and Values: Region: Panama, WRI: 7.7, Exposure: 17.27, Vulnerability: 44.56, Susceptibility: 30.57, Lack of Coping Capabilities: 67.17, Lack of Adaptive Capacities: 35.94, Year: 2011, Exposure Category: High, WRI Category: Medium, Vulnerability Category: Low, Susceptibility Category: Medium\n\n2. Descriptive Sentence: Panama in 2011 faced high exposure (17.27) with a medium WRI (7.7), resulting in low vulnerability (44.56) due to medium susceptibility (30.57), moderate lack of coping capabilities (67.17), and relatively low lack of adaptive capacities (35.94).\n\n3. Summary Statement: Panama in 2011 showed relatively low vulnerability despite high exposure, suggesting reasonably effective coping and adaptive strategies.\n\n\n**Region: Kenia**\n\n1. Column Names and Values: Region: Kenia, WRI: 7.82, Exposure: 11.9, Vulnerability: 65.75, Susceptibility: 54.51, Lack of Coping Capabilities: 87.6, Lack of Adaptive Capacities: 55.14, Year: 2011, Exposure Category: Medium, WRI Category: High, Vulnerability Category: Very High, Susceptibility Category: Very High\n\n2. Descriptive Sentence:  In Kenia during 2011, medium exposure (11.9) coupled with a high WRI (7.82) contributed to very high vulnerability (65.75), primarily due to very high susceptibility (54.51) and significantly worsened by very high lack of coping capabilities (87.6) and high lack of adaptive capacities (55.14).\n\n3. Summary Statement: Kenia in 2011 demonstrated very high vulnerability despite only medium exposure,  pointing towards substantial shortcomings in both coping and adaptive capacities."
