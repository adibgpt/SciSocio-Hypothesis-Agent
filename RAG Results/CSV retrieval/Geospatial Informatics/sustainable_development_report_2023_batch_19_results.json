        "response": "Here's an analysis of the provided data, presented as requested.  Note that some goal scores are missing (represented by blanks).\n\n**Lebanon (LBN):**  Lebanon, located in the MENA region, achieved an overall score of 67.52,  with its highest scores in Goal 1 (98.73) and Goal 4 (99.62), indicating strong performance in those areas, while Goal 17 (30.08) shows a significant weakness.  Goals 2, 8, 15, and 16 also show relatively low scores compared to others, suggesting areas needing improvement.  The overall score indicates a moderate level of achievement across the 17 goals.\n\n**Suriname (SUR):**  Suriname, in the LAC region, received an overall score of 68.25.  While lacking data for Goal 1 and Goal 10,  Suriname demonstrates relatively consistent performance across most goals, with no exceptionally high or low scores aside from Goal 9 (42.12).  The relatively high scores in goals 12, 13, 14, and 15 suggest strengths in those particular areas.  Further analysis is needed due to the missing data points.\n\n**Turkmenistan (TKM):** Turkmenistan, situated in the E. Europe & C. Asia region, obtained an overall score of 68.47.  Similar to Suriname, Turkmenistan exhibits high scores in Goals 1 (98.92) and 4 (99.64) but a considerably low score in Goal 9 (16.08), highlighting a significant disparity in performance across different goals. Missing data in Goals 10 and 14 prevents a complete assessment.  The overall score suggests a relatively balanced performance despite these significant discrepancies.\n\n**Mauritius (MUS):** Mauritius, from the Sub-Saharan Africa region, achieved an overall score of 67.98, demonstrating strong performance in Goal 1 (98.03) and Goal 13 (91.39), while showing relatively weaker performance in Goals 9 (51.79), 14 (48.97), and 15 (27.41).  The considerable difference between the highest and lowest goal scores indicates significant variation in achievement across the different goals.\n\n**Saudi Arabia (SAU):** Saudi Arabia, also in the MENA region, received an overall score of 67.69, with a perfect score in Goal 1 (100) and relatively lower scores in Goals 5 (44.60), 13 (33.75), and 15 (49.01).  Missing data for Goal 10 limits a comprehensive analysis, but the scores suggest a need for improvement in several areas despite high performance in some goals."
