        "response": "Here's an analysis of the provided data, presented as requested:\n\n\n**Row 1 (Year 2013):**  In 2013, Algeria (country code DZA) achieved an SDG index score of 71.2, indicating a moderate level of progress across various sustainable development goals.  Specifically, strong performances were observed in Goal 1 (96.8), Goal 4 (86.4), Goal 10 (97), and Goal 12 (89.1),  while weaker areas included Goal 2 (56), Goal 5 (53), Goal 6 (57.8), and Goal 9 (22.6). This suggests that while Algeria made significant strides in areas like poverty reduction and education, substantial improvements are needed in food security, gender equality, water and sanitation, and industrial innovation.\n\n**Row 2 (Year 2009):**  The 2009 data for Algeria (DZA) shows an SDG index score of 68.8, lower than the 2013 score.  Goal 1 (95.4) and Goal 10 (97) again show strong performance, but Goal 5 (37.5) highlights significant challenges in gender equality compared to other goals.  The relatively consistent high scores in Goals 1 and 10 suggest consistent progress in those areas, while the lower overall index score in 2009 compared to 2013 indicates overall improvement over time.\n\n**Row 3 (Year 2011):** In 2011, Algeria (DZA) had an SDG index score of 69.4, showing a slight increase from 2009.  While Goal 1 (96.1) and Goal 10 (97) remain strong, Goal 5 (38.5) continues to be a significant area for improvement, indicating persistent challenges in gender equality. The modest increase in the SDG index score from 2009 suggests gradual progress across various SDGs.\n\n**Row 4 (Year 2012):**  Algeria's (DZA) SDG index score in 2012 reached 71.2, mirroring the 2013 score.  Goal 4 (90.8) shows a notable improvement from previous years, while Goal 5 (51.8) shows some improvement in gender equality compared to previous years, although it remains a relatively low score. The consistent high scores in Goals 1 and 10, coupled with improvements in other areas, indicate continued progress across various SDGs.\n\n**Row 5 (Year 2010):**  Algeria (DZA) recorded an SDG index score of 69 in 2010. Similar to previous years, Goals 1 (95.4) and 10 (97) demonstrate strong performance.  Goal 5 (37.9) again indicates a persistent need for advancements in gender equality. The SDG index score in 2010 is similar to that of 2009 and 2011, suggesting a period of relatively stable progress before the improvement seen in 2012 and 2013."
