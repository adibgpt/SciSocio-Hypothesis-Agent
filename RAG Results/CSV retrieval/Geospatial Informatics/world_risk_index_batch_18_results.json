        "response": "Here's an analysis of the provided data, presented as requested:\n\n\n**Kolumbien (2011):**  In Kolumbien in 2011, the Water Risk Index (WRI) was 6.86 (Medium category), indicating a medium level of water risk,  with exposure to water-related hazards scored at 14.0 (Medium category).  Overall vulnerability was 49.03 (Medium category), composed of susceptibility at 30.81 (Medium category), a lack of coping capabilities at 75.75, and a lack of adaptive capacities at 40.52.  This suggests that while exposure is moderate, the high lack of coping capabilities contributes significantly to the overall medium vulnerability level.\n\n\n**Jemen (2011):**  Yemen in 2011 exhibited a WRI of 6.83 (Medium category) despite low exposure (10.23), suggesting other factors heavily influence the water risk.  High vulnerability (66.76, Very High category) was primarily driven by extremely low coping capabilities (87.27) and a substantial lack of adaptive capacities (65.7), resulting in high susceptibility (47.3, High category). The high vulnerability is noteworthy despite relatively low exposure.\n\n\n**Aserbaidschan (2011):** In Aserbaidschan during 2011, the WRI was 6.8 (Medium category), with moderate exposure (13.9, Medium category) and moderate vulnerability (48.94, Medium category). This vulnerability stemmed from moderate susceptibility (32.64, Medium category), along with a lack of coping capabilities (68.01) and adaptive capacities (46.16), both contributing to the overall medium vulnerability level.  The relatively balanced scores across different vulnerability components suggest a more manageable water risk profile compared to Yemen.\n\n\n**\u00c4quatorialguinea (2011):** \u00c4quatorialguinea in 2011 had a WRI of 6.72 (Medium category) despite low exposure (11.71, Low category).  High vulnerability (57.36, High category) arose from high susceptibility (34.82, High category) and significantly low coping (87.01) and adaptive capacities (50.25).  Similar to Yemen, the high vulnerability is noteworthy given the relatively low exposure, indicating significant underlying vulnerabilities.\n\n\n**Trinidad und Tobago (2011):** Trinidad und Tobago, in 2011, showed a WRI of 6.7 (Medium category) but with high exposure (15.97, High category).  However,  low vulnerability (41.98, Low category) was observed due to low susceptibility (20.1, Low category) and relatively better coping (68.6) and adaptive capacities (37.22). This suggests effective coping mechanisms and adaptive capacities mitigate the impact of high exposure."
