        "response": "Here's an analysis of the provided data, following the requested format:\n\n\n**Sri Lanka (2011):**  In Sri Lanka in 2011, high exposure (15.05) combined with medium vulnerability (52.14),  resulting in a high Water Risk Index (WRI) of 7.84; this vulnerability stemmed from medium susceptibility (29.49), significantly high lack of coping capabilities (81.02), and moderate lack of adaptive capacities (45.91).  Summary: Despite medium susceptibility, Sri Lanka faced high water risk due to severely limited coping capabilities.\n\n\n**Algeria (2011):** In Algeria in 2011, high exposure (16.51) contributed to a high Water Risk Index (WRI) of 8.06; however,  its vulnerability was categorized as medium (48.8),  reflecting low susceptibility (22.89), high lack of coping capabilities (76.36), and moderate lack of adaptive capacities (47.14). Summary: Algeria, despite high exposure, exhibited a relatively lower vulnerability compared to other countries due to lower susceptibility.\n\n\n**Angola (2011):**  Angola in 2011 experienced a high Water Risk Index (WRI) of 8.02, driven by medium exposure (12.88) and high vulnerability (62.28); this high vulnerability was characterized by very high susceptibility (53.64), extremely high lack of coping capabilities (82.84), and high lack of adaptive capacities (50.35). Summary: Angola's high water risk was a consequence of its high vulnerability across all measured aspects.\n\n\n**Samoa (2011):**  Samoa in 2011 showed high exposure (14.95) and a high Water Risk Index (WRI) of 7.88; its medium vulnerability (52.69) was due to medium susceptibility (30.49), high lack of coping capabilities (79.85), and moderate lack of adaptive capacities (47.73). Summary: Samoa's high water risk was primarily driven by limited coping capabilities despite moderate susceptibility.\n\n\n**Lesotho (2011):** In Lesotho in 2011, medium exposure (12.46) resulted in a high Water Risk Index (WRI) of 7.86; this was attributed to high vulnerability (63.12), stemming from very high susceptibility (52.04), extremely high lack of coping capabilities (83.46), and high lack of adaptive capacities (53.86). Summary:  Lesotho's high water risk was primarily due to extremely limited coping capabilities and high susceptibility, despite only medium exposure."
