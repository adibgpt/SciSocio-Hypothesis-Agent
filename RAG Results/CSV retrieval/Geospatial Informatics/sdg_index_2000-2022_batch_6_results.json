        "response": "Here's an analysis of the provided data, presented as requested:\n\n\n**Row 1 (Year 2006):**  In 2006, Albania (country code ALB) achieved an SDG index score of 66.6,  with notably high scores in Goal 1 (96.4) and Goal 10 (88.1), indicating strong performance in poverty reduction and reduced inequalities, but lower scores in Goal 2 (44.6), Goal 5 (38.6), and Goal 14 (38) suggesting challenges in ending hunger, achieving gender equality, and conserving marine life.  This suggests a need for focused interventions in areas like food security and gender equality despite progress in other SDGs.\n\n\n**Row 2 (Year 2003):**  Albania (ALB) in 2003 had an SDG index score of 65.7, showing relatively consistent performance across goals compared to 2006, with high scores in Goal 1 (96.4) and lower scores in Goal 2 (43.7), Goal 5 (37.5), and Goal 9 (17.6), again highlighting persistent issues in hunger, gender equality, and industry innovation. The SDG index score was slightly lower than in later years, indicating potential improvement over time.\n\n\n**Row 3 (Year 2004):** In 2004, Albania (ALB) recorded an SDG index score of 66.2, showing a slight improvement from 2003.  Similar to previous years, Goal 1 (96.4) remained very high, while scores for Goal 2 (44.1), Goal 5 (38), and Goal 9 (17.7) remained relatively low, continuing to point to areas requiring attention. The slight increase in the SDG index score suggests a gradual positive trend.\n\n\n**Row 4 (Year 2005):**  Albania (ALB)'s SDG index score in 2005 was 66.5, demonstrating a continued upward trend from previous years.  Again, Goal 1 (96.4) performed exceptionally well, contrasting with lower scores in Goal 2 (44.2), Goal 5 (38.5), and Goal 9 (18.2), indicating ongoing challenges in hunger, gender equality and industrialization. The steady increase in the overall SDG index score suggests consistent progress across various development goals.\n\n\n**Row 5 (Year 2002):**  The data for Albania (ALB) in 2002 reveals an SDG index score of 65.7, similar to 2003.  The country showed strong performance in Goal 1 (96.4) and relatively weaker performance in Goal 2 (45.4), Goal 5 (37.4), and Goal 9 (17.6),  mirroring patterns observed in subsequent years.  The relatively consistent score across several years indicates a stable but potentially improvable developmental trajectory."
