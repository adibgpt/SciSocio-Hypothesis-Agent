        "response": "Here's an analysis of the provided data, presented as requested:\n\n\n**Salomonen (2013):**  In 2013, the Solomon Islands (Region: Salomonen) exhibited a very high WRI (18.11) and exposure (29.98), resulting in a high vulnerability score (60.4) driven by high susceptibility (43.96), a significant lack of coping capabilities (84.15), and a moderate lack of adaptive capacities (53.09).  This suggests that despite relatively lower exposure compared to other regions, the Solomon Islands' high vulnerability is primarily due to limited adaptive and coping mechanisms.\n\n**Costa Rica (2013):** In 2013, Costa Rica (Region: Costa Rica) had a very high WRI (16.94) and exposure (42.61), yet demonstrated low vulnerability (39.75) due to low susceptibility (21.58), despite a moderate lack of coping capabilities (64.1) and a low lack of adaptive capacities (33.58).  This indicates that despite high exposure, effective adaptive and coping strategies contribute significantly to lower vulnerability in Costa Rica compared to other regions.\n\n**Bangladesch (2013):** In 2013, Bangladesh (Region: Bangladesch) showed a very high WRI (19.81) and exposure (31.7), leading to high vulnerability (62.5) characterized by high susceptibility (40.92), a substantial lack of coping capabilities (86.23), and a high lack of adaptive capacities (60.34). This suggests that Bangladesh's high vulnerability stems from both high exposure and significant deficiencies in coping and adaptive capacities, similar to the Solomon Islands.\n\n**Philippinen (2013):** The Philippines (Region: Philippinen) in 2013 displayed a very high WRI (27.52) and exposure (52.46), resulting in a medium vulnerability (52.46) despite high susceptibility (33.74), high lack of coping capabilities (80.47), and moderate lack of adaptive capacities (43.16).  This suggests that while exposure and lack of coping capabilities are high, other factors contribute to a comparatively lower vulnerability than other regions with similar susceptibility.\n\n**Guatemala (2013):**  Guatemala (Region: Guatemala) in 2013 had a very high WRI (20.88) and exposure (36.3), leading to high vulnerability (57.53) due to high susceptibility (38.57), high lack of coping capabilities (80.8), and moderate lack of adaptive capacities (53.21).  This indicates that Guatemala's vulnerability is driven by a combination of exposure and deficiencies in coping and adaptive capacities, similar to Bangladesh."
