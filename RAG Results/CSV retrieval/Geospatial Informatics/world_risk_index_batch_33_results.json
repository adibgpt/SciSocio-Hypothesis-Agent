        "response": "Here's an analysis of the provided data, presented as requested:\n\n\n**\u00c4gypten (Egypt):**  In 2011, \u00c4gypten had a very low Water Resources Index (WRI) of 2.38 and very low exposure (4.79) to climate-related hazards, yet exhibited a medium vulnerability (49.62) due to a medium susceptibility (23.2), high lack of coping capabilities (76.62), and medium lack of adaptive capacities (49.04).  This suggests that despite low exposure, pre-existing societal factors significantly contribute to Egypt's vulnerability to climate change impacts in 2011.\n\n\n**Estland (Estonia):** In 2011, Estland displayed a very low WRI (2.25) and very low exposure (6.8), resulting in very low vulnerability (33.15). This low vulnerability was further characterized by low susceptibility (17.9), moderate lack of coping capabilities (51.09), and low lack of adaptive capacities (30.47).  Estonia demonstrates comparatively strong resilience to climate-related risks in 2011, despite a moderate lack of coping capabilities.\n\n\n**Grenada:** In 2011, Grenada showed a very low WRI (2.29) and very low exposure (4.9), but presented a medium vulnerability (46.71) stemming from medium susceptibility (26.14), high lack of coping capabilities (68.7), and medium lack of adaptive capacities (45.29). Similar to Egypt, Grenada's vulnerability is driven primarily by its socio-economic factors rather than direct exposure to climate hazards.\n\n\n**Norwegen (Norway):**  In 2011, Norwegen had a very low WRI (2.28) and very low vulnerability (26.09), despite a very low exposure (8.75). This low vulnerability is attributed to very low susceptibility (13.98), low lack of coping capabilities (38.52), and low lack of adaptive capacities (25.77). Norway exhibits high resilience to climate risks in 2011, indicated by its low vulnerability across all measured factors.\n\n\n**Barbados:** In 2011, Barbados presented a very low WRI (2.44) and very low exposure (6.87), leading to very low vulnerability (35.54). This low vulnerability is supported by very low susceptibility (15.76), moderate lack of coping capabilities (50.34), and low lack of adaptive capacities (40.52).  Barbados, like Norway, demonstrates strong resilience against climate change impacts in 2011."
