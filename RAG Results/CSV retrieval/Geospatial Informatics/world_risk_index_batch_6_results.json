        "response": "Here's an analysis of the provided data, formatted as requested:\n\n\n**Indonesia (2011):**  In Indonesia in 2011, the Water Risk Index (WRI) was very high (11.69), reflecting very high exposure (20.49) combined with high vulnerability (57.06), which itself stemmed from high susceptibility (37.66), high lack of coping capabilities (83.31), and moderate lack of adaptive capacities (50.2).  This suggests that despite relatively lower exposure compared to other nations, Indonesia faced significant vulnerability due to limited adaptive and coping mechanisms.\n\n\n**Burundi (2011):**  Burundi in 2011 showed a very high Water Risk Index (11.56), characterized by high exposure (16.09) and extremely high vulnerability (71.82). This vulnerability was driven by very high susceptibility (63.88), extremely high lack of coping capabilities (90.68), and high lack of adaptive capacities (60.89). Burundi exhibited exceptionally high vulnerability despite relatively moderate exposure, highlighting a critical need for improved coping and adaptive strategies.\n\n\n**Mauritius (2011):**  Mauritius in 2011 had a very high Water Risk Index (11.91) due to very high exposure (29.59), but surprisingly low vulnerability (40.24). This low vulnerability was a result of low susceptibility (19.57), moderate lack of coping capabilities (60.08), and low lack of adaptive capacities (41.08).  Despite high exposure, Mauritius demonstrated effective coping and adaptation mechanisms resulting in lower overall vulnerability.\n\n\n**Senegal (2011):** In Senegal during 2011, the very high Water Risk Index (11.76) was a consequence of very high exposure (18.7) and high vulnerability (62.9).  This high vulnerability stemmed from high susceptibility (49.02), high lack of coping capabilities (81.99), and moderate lack of adaptive capacities (57.68).  Senegal's high vulnerability, despite relatively moderate exposure compared to Mauritius, indicates substantial limitations in its adaptive and coping capacities.\n\n\n**Burkina Faso (2011):** Burkina Faso in 2011 presented a very high Water Risk Index (11.58) stemming from high exposure (16.92) and very high vulnerability (68.46). This vulnerability was driven by very high susceptibility (56.92), very high lack of coping capabilities (86.37), and high lack of adaptive capacities (62.09).  Burkina Faso's high vulnerability, similar to Burundi, underscores the urgent need for improved water resource management and resilience-building strategies."
