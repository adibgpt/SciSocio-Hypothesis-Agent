        "response": "Here's an analysis of the provided data, presented as requested:\n\n\n**Burundi (BDI):**  Burundi, located in Sub-Saharan Africa, achieved an overall score of 53.91.  Its scores varied across the 17 goals, with Goal 1 receiving a score of 0, Goal 2 scoring 59.52, Goal 3 at 48.55, Goal 4 at 50.18, Goal 5 at 60.49, Goal 6 at 55.23, Goal 7 at a low 19.26, Goal 8 at 54.96, Goal 9 at 12.13, Goal 10 at 58.37, Goal 11 at 60.00, Goal 12 at a high 96.55, Goal 13 at a high 99.76, Goal 14 having a missing score, Goal 15 at 72.21, Goal 16 at 50.70, and Goal 17 at 52.25.  This indicates significant disparities in performance across different Sustainable Development Goals, with particularly strong performance in Goals 12 and 13 but very weak performance in Goal 1 and Goal 7.  A missing score for Goal 14 prevents a complete assessment.\n\n\n**Nigeria (NGA):** Nigeria, also in Sub-Saharan Africa, received an overall score of 54.27.  The country's individual goal scores were: Goal 1 (49.92), Goal 2 (61.07), Goal 3 (36.20), Goal 4 (38.75), Goal 5 (39.22), Goal 6 (59.71), Goal 7 (24.98), Goal 8 (66.57), Goal 9 (40.61), Goal 10 (72.80), Goal 11 (29.44), Goal 12 (95.56), Goal 13 (96.75), Goal 14 (62.08), Goal 15 (76.36), Goal 16 (34.67), and Goal 17 (37.93).  Nigeria shows relatively consistent performance across goals, but with lower scores in Goals 3, 4, 5, 11, and 16, indicating potential areas for improvement.\n\n\n**Papua New Guinea (PNG):** Papua New Guinea, situated in Oceania, achieved an overall score of 53.60. Its individual goal scores were: Goal 1 (30.79), Goal 2 (33.95), Goal 3 (43.23), Goal 4 (53.88), Goal 5 (48.39), Goal 6 (42.49), Goal 7 (36.96), Goal 8 (76.93), Goal 9 (9.68), Goal 10 (43.69), Goal 11 (71.81), Goal 12 (96.46), Goal 13 (95.15), Goal 14 (72.13), Goal 15 (64.08), Goal 16 (52.09), and Goal 17 (39.55). This suggests areas of strength (Goals 8, 11, 12, 13, 14) and weakness (Goals 2, 9) in achieving the Sustainable Development Goals.\n\n\n**Mozambique (MOZ):** Mozambique, located in Sub-Saharan Africa, scored 52.69 overall.  The country's scores were: Goal 1 (3.15), Goal 2 (54.29), Goal 3 (31.65), Goal 4 (55.09), Goal 5 (64.95), Goal 6 (54.70), Goal 7 (35.59), Goal 8 (66.87), Goal 9 (14.09), Goal 10 (12.68), Goal 11 (62.80), Goal 12 (97.89), Goal 13 (98.30), Goal 14 (72.02), Goal 15 (63.11), Goal 16 (47.61), and Goal 17 (60.88).  Mozambique shows a similar pattern to other Sub-Saharan African countries, with high scores in Goals 12 and 13, but lower scores in Goals 1, 3, 9, and 10.\n\n\n**Djibouti (DJI):** Djibouti, also in Sub-Saharan Africa, had an overall score of 52.68.  Its goal scores were: Goal 1 (64.74), Goal 2 (53.02), Goal 3 (50.91), Goal 4 (24.33), Goal 5 (39.34), Goal 6 (57.70), Goal 7 (16.71), Goal 8 (53.57), Goal 9 (36.53), Goal 10 (44.39), Goal 11 (71.01), Goal 12 (87.76), Goal 13 (90.62), Goal 14 (57.59), Goal 15 (37.56), Goal 16 (56.54), and Goal 17 (53.22). Djibouti demonstrates significant variation in its performance across the SDGs, with relatively high scores in Goals 1, 2, 3, 6, 11, and 16, but lower scores in Goals 4, 7, and 15."
