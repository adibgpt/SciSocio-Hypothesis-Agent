        "response": "Here's an analysis of the provided data, following the requested format:\n\n\n**Fiji (2013):**  In Fiji in 2013, a very high exposure (27.71) combined with a very high Water Risk Index (WRI) of 13.56 resulted in a medium vulnerability score of 48.93, comprised of a medium susceptibility of 26.14, a high lack of coping capabilities (75.3), and a medium lack of adaptive capacities (45.35).  This suggests that while Fiji faces significant exposure to environmental hazards, its vulnerability is moderated by moderate susceptibility and adaptive capacity, although coping capabilities are a concern.\n\n\n**Guinea-Bissau (2013):** In Guinea-Bissau in 2013, very high exposure (19.65) and a very high WRI (13.09) led to extremely high vulnerability (66.58), stemming from very high susceptibility (53.39), extremely high lack of coping capabilities (87.99), and high lack of adaptive capacities (58.36). This indicates a critical situation with high exposure and extremely weak adaptive capacity contributing to very high overall vulnerability.\n\n\n**Nicaragua (2013):** In Nicaragua in 2013, very high exposure (27.23) and a very high WRI (14.89) produced a high vulnerability score (54.69), characterized by high susceptibility (37.09), very high lack of coping capabilities (81.32), and medium lack of adaptive capacities (45.65).  Nicaragua shows a high vulnerability despite similar exposure to Fiji, highlighting the importance of coping and adaptive capacities in determining overall risk.\n\n\n**Japan (2013):** In Japan in 2013, despite very high exposure (45.91) and a very high WRI (14.1), vulnerability was very low (30.71) due to low susceptibility (16.84), low lack of coping capabilities (40.08), and low lack of adaptive capacities (35.22). This demonstrates that high exposure does not automatically translate to high vulnerability, emphasizing the role of effective coping and adaptive mechanisms in mitigating risk.\n\n\n**Mauritius (2013):** In Mauritius in 2013, very high exposure (37.35) and a very high WRI (15.18) resulted in low vulnerability (40.64), reflecting low susceptibility (18.96), medium lack of coping capabilities (60.61), and medium lack of adaptive capacities (42.35). Similar to Japan, Mauritius shows that strong coping and adaptive capacities can significantly reduce vulnerability despite high exposure."
