        "response": "Here's an analysis of the provided data, presented as requested:\n\n\n**Fidschi (2011):**  In Fidschi in 2011, the Water Risk Index (WRI) was 13.57 (Very High category), indicating high water-related risks, alongside an exposure score of 25.87 (Very High),  a vulnerability score of 52.48 (Medium category), a susceptibility score of 36.32 (High category), a lack of coping capabilities score of 76.44, and a lack of adaptive capacities score of 44.67.  This suggests that while Fidschi faces very high exposure to water-related hazards, its vulnerability is moderate, likely due to a mix of high susceptibility and relatively lower lack of coping/adaptive capacities compared to other nations in this dataset.\n\n\n**Guinea-Bissau (2011):** In Guinea-Bissau in 2011, a very high Water Risk Index (WRI) of 13.12, coupled with high exposure (18.53, Very High category), extremely high vulnerability (70.84, Very High category), very high susceptibility (59.51, Very High category), and extremely high lack of coping (89.76) and adaptive capacities (63.26), paints a picture of a nation severely threatened by water scarcity and associated risks.  The high values across all indicators point to a critical need for improved water management and resilience-building strategies.\n\n\n**Bhutan (2011):** In Bhutan in 2011, the Water Risk Index (WRI) was 13.65 (Very High category), with high exposure (24.63, Very High category), high vulnerability (55.42, High category), high susceptibility (34.56, High category), high lack of coping capabilities (79.02), and moderate lack of adaptive capacities (52.67).  Despite high exposure and vulnerability, Bhutan shows relatively lower scores for lack of coping and adaptive capacities than Guinea-Bissau or Niger, suggesting a potentially stronger foundation for resilience-building.\n\n\n**Niger (2011):**  In Niger in 2011, the very high Water Risk Index (WRI) of 14.03, combined with high exposure (18.49, Very High category), extremely high vulnerability (75.86, Very High category), very high susceptibility (69.38, Very High category), and extremely high lack of coping (89.54) and adaptive capacities (68.65), indicates an extremely precarious situation concerning water resources.  The extremely high scores across all indicators highlight a critical need for immediate and substantial interventions to improve water security and build resilience.\n\n\n**Gambia (2011):**  The Gambia in 2011 exhibited a very high Water Risk Index (WRI) of 13.9, alongside very high exposure (22.2, Very High category), high vulnerability (62.63, High category), high susceptibility (45.29, High category), and very high lack of coping capabilities (83.99) and high lack of adaptive capacities (58.62).  This suggests a significant vulnerability to water-related risks, although slightly lower than Guinea-Bissau or Niger, highlighting the need for targeted interventions to improve water resource management and build community resilience."
