        "response": "Here's an analysis of the provided data, following the requested format:\n\n\n**Kambodscha (2013):**  In Kambodscha in 2013, a very high exposure (27.65) combined with high vulnerability (61.12), primarily driven by high susceptibility (43.47),  lack of coping capabilities (86.6), and lack of adaptive capacities (53.28), resulted in a very high Water Risk Index (WRI) of 16.9.  This indicates a high level of risk related to water resources in the region.\n\n\n**El Salvador (2013):**  El Salvador in 2013 experienced very high exposure to water risks (32.6), leading to a very high WRI (16.85), although its vulnerability (51.69) was categorized as medium due to medium susceptibility (29.5), high lack of coping capabilities (75.69), and moderate lack of adaptive capacities (49.88). This suggests that despite high exposure,  adaptive capacity plays a role in mitigating the overall water risk.\n\n\n**Brunei Darussalam (2013):**  Brunei Darussalam in 2013 had very high exposure (41.1) to water-related hazards, yet exhibited a very high WRI (15.8) that is surprisingly low considering its exposure. This is due to low vulnerability (38.44) resulting from very low susceptibility (14.48), despite a moderate lack of coping capabilities (64.69) and lack of adaptive capacities (36.15).  This suggests that other factors, not captured in this data, might be contributing to a lower overall water risk.\n\n\n**Timor-Leste (2013):** In Timor-Leste during 2013, very high exposure to water risks (25.73) coupled with very high vulnerability (63.61), stemming from very high susceptibility (52.16), high lack of coping capabilities (79.36), and lack of adaptive capacities (59.31), resulted in a very high WRI (16.37). This indicates a very serious water risk situation.\n\n\n**Papua-Neuguinea (2013):** Papua-Neuguinea in 2013 faced very high exposure (24.94) and very high vulnerability (63.77) to water-related risks, characterized by very high susceptibility (51.22), high lack of coping capabilities (83.99), and lack of adaptive capacities (56.1), leading to a very high WRI of 15.9.  The combination of high exposure and vulnerability points to a critical need for improved water resource management."
