        "response": "Here's an analysis of the provided data, presented as requested:\n\n\n**Row 1 (Year 2003):**  In 2003, Azerbaijan (country code AZE) achieved an SDG index score of 66.5, with a perfect score of 100 for Goal 1 (No Poverty) but relatively lower scores in other areas such as Goal 2 (Zero Hunger) at 58.9, Goal 3 (Good Health and Well-being) at 56.6, and Goal 9 (Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure) at a mere 15.3.  This suggests a significant disparity in progress across different SDGs, with strong performance in poverty reduction but considerable room for improvement in areas like infrastructure and industrial development.\n\n\n**Row 2 (Year 2001):**  Azerbaijan's (AZE) SDG index score in 2001 was 63.7, also showing a perfect score of 100 for Goal 1 (No Poverty), but lower scores across other goals, including Goal 2 (Zero Hunger) at 56.2, Goal 9 (Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure) at 14.7, and Goal 10 (Reduced Inequalities) at 66.7. Compared to 2003, the overall SDG index score and scores for most goals were slightly lower, indicating potential challenges in achieving sustainable development goals at the start of the new millennium.\n\n\n**Row 3 (Year 2005):**  The 2005 data for Azerbaijan (AZE) reveals an SDG index score of 67, maintaining a perfect score of 100 for Goal 1 (No Poverty) and showing slight improvements in several goals compared to previous years, such as Goal 2 (Zero Hunger) increasing to 61.2 and Goal 9 (Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure) to 15.4.  This indicates continued progress in poverty reduction and some advancement in other areas, though Goal 9 continues to lag behind.\n\n\n**Row 4 (Year 2004):** In 2004, Azerbaijan (AZE) recorded an SDG index score of 66.9, again with a perfect 100 for Goal 1 (No Poverty).  Scores for other goals showed moderate improvement over previous years, with Goal 2 (Zero Hunger) at 60.9 and Goal 9 (Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure) at 15.3, suggesting a gradual but consistent improvement in various aspects of sustainable development.\n\n\n**Row 5 (Year 2002):** Azerbaijan (AZE) in 2002 had an SDG index score of 66.4, maintaining the perfect score of 100 for Goal 1 (No Poverty).  Goal 2 (Zero Hunger) stood at 58.2, while Goal 9 (Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure) was at 15.1 and Goal 10 (Reduced Inequalities) was at 99.3, showing a relatively high score in reducing inequalities. This illustrates a consistently high performance in poverty reduction while progress in other sectors remained relatively stable compared to other years."
