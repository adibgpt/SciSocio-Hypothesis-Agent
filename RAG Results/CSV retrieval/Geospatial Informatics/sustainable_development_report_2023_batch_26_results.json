        "response": "Here's an analysis of the provided data, presented as requested:\n\n\n**Row 1 (Pakistan):**  The country code PAK represents Pakistan, located in the East & South Asia region, achieving an overall score of 58.97.  This score is comprised of individual goal scores ranging from a high of 96.61 (Goal 13) to a low of 33.49 (Goal 9), indicating significant variation in performance across different Sustainable Development Goals.  Pakistan shows particular strength in Goals 10 and 12, but considerable weakness in Goals 9 and 5.\n\n**Row 2 (Guatemala):**  Guatemala (GTM), situated in the LAC region, received an overall score of 59.38, reflecting a relatively balanced performance across the goals.  While scoring highly on Goals 12 and 13 (90.39 and 95.89 respectively), Guatemala demonstrates lower performance in Goals 9 and 10 (23.14 and 20.70 respectively), suggesting areas for improvement in these specific areas.\n\n**Row 3 (Rwanda):** Rwanda (RWA), in Sub-Saharan Africa, obtained an overall score of 60.20.  The country shows strong performance in Goals 5, 12, and 13 (77.24, 94.65, and 99.27 respectively) but relatively low scores in Goals 1 and 7 (23.46 and 33.67 respectively), highlighting a need for focused interventions in these areas to achieve greater balance.  Note that Goal 14's score is missing.\n\n**Row 4 (Syrian Arab Republic):** The Syrian Arab Republic (SYR), from the MENA region, achieved an overall score of 58.18.  The data reveals strong performance in Goals 3, 6, 7, 8, and 10, but weak performance in Goals 1, 2, and 9, indicating significant disparities in progress across different SDGs.  The missing Goal 1 score prevents a complete assessment.\n\n**Row 5 (Gambia):** The Gambia (GMB), also in Sub-Saharan Africa, received an overall score of 58.30.  The country exhibits relatively strong performance in Goals 12, 13, and 15 (96.17, 99.02, and 83.03 respectively), while demonstrating weaker performance in Goals 7 and 9 (30.44 and 24.64 respectively), suggesting a need for concentrated efforts to address these disparities."
