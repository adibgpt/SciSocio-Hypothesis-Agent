        "response": "Here's an analysis of the provided data, presented as requested:\n\n**Row 1 (Year 2015):**  In 2015, Azerbaijan (AZE) achieved an SDG index score of 71.4,  with notably high scores in Goal 1 (100) and Goal 10 (97.5), indicating strong performance in poverty eradication and reduced inequalities.  However, scores were significantly lower in Goal 9 (37.4) and Goal 14 (0), highlighting challenges in industry, innovation, and infrastructure, and particularly in life below water.  This suggests a need for focused efforts to address these lagging areas while maintaining progress in other SDGs.\n\n**Row 2 (Year 2013):**  Azerbaijan's (AZE) 2013 SDG index score was 70.7, showing a similar pattern to 2015 with excellent performance in poverty eradication (Goal 1: 100) and reduced inequalities (Goal 10: 97.5).  Lower scores persisted in Goal 9 (32.5) and Goal 14 (0), indicating ongoing challenges in industry and marine life.  Compared to 2015, there's only a slight improvement in the overall SDG index score, suggesting limited progress across most goals.\n\n**Row 3 (Year 2014):**  In 2014, Azerbaijan (AZE) recorded an SDG index score of 71.3, slightly higher than 2013.  Again, Goal 1 (100) and Goal 10 (97.5) showed exceptional performance, while Goal 9 (37) and Goal 14 (0) remained significantly low.  The marginal improvement suggests slow progress across most SDGs, with persistent challenges in industry, innovation, and the marine environment.\n\n**Row 4 (Year 2011):**  Azerbaijan (AZE) had an SDG index score of 69 in 2011.  While Goal 1 (100) and Goal 10 (97.5) continued to show strong performance, Goal 9 (22.9) displayed a particularly low score, indicating substantial challenges in industry and innovation.  Goal 14 (0) remained at zero, highlighting consistent issues related to life below water.  This data shows a lower overall SDG index score compared to subsequent years, suggesting improvement in subsequent years.\n\n**Row 5 (Year 2012):**  In 2012, Azerbaijan (AZE) achieved an SDG index score of 69.7, a slight improvement over 2011.  The consistently high scores for Goal 1 (100) and Goal 10 (97.5) are noteworthy, contrasting sharply with the persistently low score for Goal 9 (27.9) and the zero score for Goal 14.  This suggests a continuing need for focused investment in industry, innovation, and marine environmental protection."
