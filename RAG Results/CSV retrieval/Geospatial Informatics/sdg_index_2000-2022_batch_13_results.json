        "response": "Here's an analysis of the provided data, presented as requested:\n\n\n**Row 1 (Year 2018):**  In 2018, Algeria (country code DZA) achieved an SDG index score of 71.7, indicating a relatively high overall performance across the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).  Notably, Algeria scored exceptionally well on Goal 1 (97.4) and Goal 10 (97), suggesting strong progress in poverty reduction and reducing inequalities, while showing comparatively lower scores in Goal 2 (57.1), Goal 5 (49.4), Goal 9 (44.7), indicating areas needing improvement in zero hunger, gender equality, and industry, innovation, and infrastructure. This suggests a need for focused interventions in these specific areas to achieve more balanced SDG progress.\n\n\n**Row 2 (Year 2015):** In 2015, Algeria (DZA) had an SDG index score of 72.2, slightly higher than in 2018.  Similar to 2018, Goal 1 (97.2) and Goal 10 (97) showed high scores, demonstrating consistent strength in poverty reduction and inequality reduction. However,  Goals 2 (55.1), 5 (54.1), and 9 (34.3) again reveal comparatively weaker performance areas,  highlighting ongoing challenges in food security, gender equality, and industrial development.  The slight decrease in the overall SDG index score from 2015 to 2018 suggests that despite consistent strengths, some progress may have stalled or even slightly regressed in certain SDG areas.\n\n\n**Row 3 (Year 2014):** The 2014 data for Algeria (DZA) shows an SDG index score of 71.8, very similar to the 2018 score.  Again, high scores in Goal 1 (97) and Goal 10 (97) were observed, demonstrating sustained success in poverty reduction and inequality reduction.  The lowest scores were in Goal 9 (30), indicating significant challenges in industrial development and innovation, with relatively lower scores also observed in Goals 2 (53.9) and 5 (53) reflecting ongoing challenges in food security and gender equality. This shows a consistent pattern of strong performance in some areas contrasted by persistent weaknesses in others.\n\n\n**Row 4 (Year 2016):**  Algeria's (DZA) SDG index score in 2016 was 71.9, maintaining a relatively consistent level across the years.  While Goal 1 (97.3) and Goal 10 (97) remain strong performers, showing continued progress in poverty reduction and reduced inequalities, Goal 9 (39) continues to lag significantly behind other goals, suggesting persistent obstacles in industrial development and innovation.  Goals 2 (54.3) and 5 (54.9) also showed modest improvement compared to 2014.  This shows a persistent pattern of strong performance in some areas and persistent underperformance in others.\n\n\n**Row 5 (Year 2017):**  In 2017, Algeria (DZA) achieved an SDG index score of 72, a slight improvement over previous years.  The consistently high scores for Goal 1 (97.3) and Goal 10 (97) are maintained, indicating continued success in poverty reduction and inequality reduction. However, Goal 9 (43.5) shows a small improvement but remains a relatively weak area, while Goal 5 (52.3) shows a slight decline. This highlights the need for targeted interventions to address persistent challenges in industrial development and gender equality."
