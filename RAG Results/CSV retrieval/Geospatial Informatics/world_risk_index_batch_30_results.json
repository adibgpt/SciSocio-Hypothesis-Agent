        "response": "Here's an analysis of the provided data, presented as requested:\n\n\n**Ukraine (2011):**  In 2011, Ukraine had a Water Risk Index (WRI) of 3.02, categorized as very low, despite facing an exposure level of 7.2 (very low category).  Its vulnerability score was 41.91 (low category), primarily driven by a lack of coping capabilities (62.05) and adaptive capacities (42.2).  This suggests that while Ukraine's direct exposure to water-related risks was low, its inherent vulnerability was moderate due to significant limitations in its capacity to manage and adapt to such risks.\n\n**Latvia (2011):**  Latvia in 2011 exhibited a very low WRI of 3.09, alongside a very low exposure score of 8.66. Its vulnerability score of 35.63 (very low category) resulted from relatively lower susceptibility (21.39, low category), lack of coping capabilities (55.32), and lack of adaptive capacities (30.17). This indicates that Latvia, similar to Ukraine, had low exposure but moderate vulnerability stemming from limited coping and adaptive mechanisms.\n\n\n**Spain (2011):**  In 2011, Spain had a very low WRI of 3.29, with a low exposure level of 10.65.  Its vulnerability was very low (30.87), reflecting low susceptibility (15.06, very low category), lack of coping capabilities (49.65), and lack of adaptive capacities (27.91). This suggests that Spain, while facing slightly higher exposure compared to Ukraine and Latvia, possessed significantly better adaptive capacities and thus a lower overall vulnerability.\n\n**Germany (2011):** Germany in 2011 showed a very low WRI of 2.96 and a low exposure level of 11.14.  Its very low vulnerability score of 26.55 stemmed from low susceptibility (14.78, very low category), and relatively low scores for lack of coping capabilities (39.2) and adaptive capacities (25.67). This indicates that Germany had the lowest vulnerability among the countries listed, demonstrating effective coping and adaptive mechanisms despite a relatively high exposure.\n\n**Belarus (2011):** Belarus in 2011 had a very low WRI of 2.98 and a very low exposure of 8.03. However, its vulnerability score of 37.15 (low category) was higher than that of Spain and Germany, primarily due to a higher lack of coping capabilities (58.07) and adaptive capacities (36.19) than the other countries despite a low susceptibility (17.19, low category). This suggests that despite low exposure, Belarus faced moderate vulnerability due to limitations in its capacity to manage water-related risks."
