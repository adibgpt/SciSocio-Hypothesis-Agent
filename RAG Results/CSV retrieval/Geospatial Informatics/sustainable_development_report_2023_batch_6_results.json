        "response": "Here's an analysis of the provided data, presented as requested:\n\n\n**Canada (CAN):**  Canada, an OECD country, achieved an overall score of 78.497, reflecting strong performance in goals 1 (99.60%), 3 (93.87%), and 4 (99.40%), but showing areas for improvement in goals 12 (51.69%), 13 (39.62%), and 15 (60.78%).  This suggests a need for focused action on environmental sustainability and responsible consumption.\n\n**Greece (GRC):** Greece, another OECD member, scored 78.369 overall, demonstrating relatively high scores in goals 1 (99.23%), 4 (97.14%), and 6 (87.65%), while underperforming in goals 2 (66.62%), 8 (73.79%), and 16 (71.08%). This indicates a potential imbalance between social progress and economic development.\n\n**Iceland (ISL):** Iceland, also in the OECD, obtained an overall score of 78.266, excelling in goals 1 (99.86%), 3 (96.41%), 4 (98.09%), 5 (94.02%), 7 (99.55%), and 10 (100%), but lagging in goals 6 (59.79%), 12 (37.73%), and 13 (51.42%). This highlights a notable disparity between its environmental performance and its progress in clean water and sanitation.\n\n**Chile (CHL):** Chile, an OECD country, achieved an overall score of 78.224, with relatively high scores in goals 4 (97.77%), 6 (89.38%), and 13 (82.28%), yet significantly lower scores in goal 10 (25.49%). This points to a considerable gap in reducing inequalities within the country.\n\n**New Zealand (NZL):** New Zealand, an OECD country, scored 78.433 overall, exhibiting strong performance in goals 3 (92.48%), 5 (91.37%), 6 (89.62%), 8 (87.75%), and 9 (89.90%), but demonstrating room for improvement in goals 2 (59.53%), 12 (49.03%), 14 (53.18%), and 15 (48.96%). This suggests a need for greater emphasis on sustainable cities and communities."
