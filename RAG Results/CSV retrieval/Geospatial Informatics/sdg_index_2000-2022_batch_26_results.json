The data shows generally similar performance across goals compared to 2014, although some goals such as Goal 9 (Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure) show improvements over time. This suggests that progress has been made in certain areas, while others require further attention.\n\n\n**Row 3 (Year 2013):** Armenia (ARM) in 2013 achieved an SDG index score of 71, showing a slight improvement over 2010.

The overall trend suggests a relatively stable performance across the SDGs with marginal improvements.\n\n\n**Row 4 (Year 2012):**  Armenia's (ARM) SDG index score in 2012 was 71.1,  similar to 2014.  The individual goal scores show a pattern consistent with previous years, with strong performance in goals like Goal 1 (No Poverty) and Goal 13 (Climate Action), and weaker performance in goals such as Goal 2 (Zero Hunger) and Goal 9 (Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure).  The data suggests that progress is uneven across the different SDGs.\n\n\n**Row 5 (Year 2011):** In 2011, Armenia (ARM) recorded an SDG index score of 70.9.  The scores across various goals show a pattern similar to other years, with high scores in goals like Goal 10 (Reduced Inequalities) and low scores in goals like Goal 14 (Life Below Water).
