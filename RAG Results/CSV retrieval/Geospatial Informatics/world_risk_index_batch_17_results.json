        "response": "Here's an analysis of the provided data, presented as requested:\n\n\n**Georgia (2011):**  In 2011, Georgia had a Water Risk Index (WRI) of 6.97 (Medium category), indicating a moderate level of water risk, alongside high exposure (15.11) and medium vulnerability (46.15), primarily driven by a significant lack of coping (66.97) and adaptive capacities (46.12).  This suggests that while exposure to water-related hazards is high, the country's vulnerability stems largely from limited capacity to manage and adapt to these risks.\n\n**Thailand (2011):** Thailand in 2011 exhibited a medium WRI (6.86), high exposure (14.84), and medium vulnerability (46.25). Despite high exposure, its susceptibility was low (22.44), but a substantial lack of coping (76.23) and moderate lack of adaptive capacities (40.1) contributed significantly to its overall vulnerability. This highlights the importance of coping mechanisms in mitigating water risk, even with relatively low susceptibility.\n\n**Turkmenistan (2011):** Turkmenistan's 2011 data shows a medium WRI (6.95), medium exposure (13.77), and medium vulnerability (50.44), although susceptibility was low (21.64).  However, the extremely high lack of coping capacities (79.27) and high lack of adaptive capacities (50.43) are major contributors to its vulnerability score.  This suggests that despite moderate exposure and low susceptibility, the absence of effective coping and adaptation strategies significantly elevates the country's overall water risk.\n\n**Armenia (2011):** In 2011, Armenia had a medium WRI (6.9), high exposure (14.67), and medium vulnerability (47.01), with medium susceptibility (26.27).  The considerable lack of coping (70.11) and moderate lack of adaptive capacities (44.64) indicate that improvements in these areas are crucial for reducing water risk. This signifies that while exposure is high, the manageable susceptibility is offset by weaknesses in coping and adaptation.\n\n\n**Comoros (2011):** The Comoros Islands in 2011 displayed a medium WRI (6.93) but very high vulnerability (68.6) and very high susceptibility (51.13) despite low exposure (10.1).  This extremely high vulnerability is primarily attributed to exceptionally high lacks of coping (85.92) and adaptive capacities (68.75). This indicates a critical need for improved coping and adaptation strategies to address the significant water risk, despite relatively low exposure."
