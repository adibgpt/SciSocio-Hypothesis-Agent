        "response": "Here's an analysis of the provided data, presented as requested:\n\n\n**Region: Vereinigte Staaten v. A.** In 2011, the United States had a low Water Risk Index (WRI) of 3.72, a medium exposure level of 12.0, and a very low vulnerability score of 30.98, composed of a low susceptibility of 16.8, a high lack of coping capabilities (48.65), and a moderate lack of adaptive capacities (27.49).  This suggests that despite a moderate exposure, the relatively low vulnerability is due to a balance of factors, with higher coping capacity limitations than adaptive capacity limitations.\n\n\n**Region: Slowenien**  In 2011, Slovenia exhibited a low Water Risk Index (WRI) of 3.72, low exposure (11.75), and very low vulnerability (31.65). This vulnerability was comprised of very low susceptibility (14.18), high lack of coping capabilities (49.12), and high lack of adaptive capacities (31.65).  Despite similar WRI and exposure to the US, Slovenia shows slightly higher vulnerability due to higher limitations in both coping and adaptive capacities.\n\n\n**Region: Kuwait** In 2011, Kuwait displayed a low Water Risk Index (WRI) of 3.71, very low exposure (8.96), and low vulnerability (41.35). This vulnerability stemmed from very low susceptibility (12.68), but significantly high lack of coping capabilities (65.33) and high lack of adaptive capacities (46.04). Kuwait's relatively low vulnerability despite high lack of coping and adaptive capacities is noteworthy, potentially indicating other mitigating factors.\n\n\n**Region: S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 und Pr\u00edncipe**  In 2011, S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe had a low Water Risk Index (WRI) of 3.73, very low exposure (6.28), but high vulnerability (59.45). This high vulnerability resulted from high susceptibility (45.58), extremely high lack of coping capabilities (80.26), and high lack of adaptive capacities (52.52). This region shows the highest vulnerability despite having the lowest exposure, highlighting the significant impact of susceptibility, lack of coping, and adaptive capacity limitations.\n\n\n**Region: Kroatien** In 2011, Croatia had a low Water Risk Index (WRI) of 3.71, low exposure (11.17), and very low vulnerability (33.22).  This vulnerability consisted of low susceptibility (16.63), high lack of coping capabilities (50.69), and moderate lack of adaptive capacities (32.35).  Similar to Slovenia, Croatia demonstrates relatively high lack of coping capabilities despite overall low vulnerability."
