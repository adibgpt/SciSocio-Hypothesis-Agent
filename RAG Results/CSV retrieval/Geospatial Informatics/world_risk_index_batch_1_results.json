        "response": "Here's an analysis of the provided data, presented as requested:\n\n\n**Solomon Islands (2011):**  In 2011, the Solomon Islands exhibited a very high WRI (23.51), very high exposure (36.4), very high vulnerability (64.6), high susceptibility (44.11), very low coping capabilities (85.95), and low adaptive capacities (63.74). This indicates extremely high risk, driven by both high exposure to hazards and severely limited capacity to cope with or adapt to them.\n\n\n**Guatemala (2011):** In 2011, Guatemala showed a very high WRI (20.88), very high exposure (38.42), high vulnerability (54.35), high susceptibility (35.36), low coping capabilities (77.83), and moderate adaptive capacities (49.87).  Despite high exposure, Guatemala's vulnerability is lower than the Solomon Islands, suggesting some better adaptive capacity, although coping capabilities remain a significant weakness.\n\n\n**Tonga (2011):** In 2011, Tonga had a very high WRI (29.08), very high exposure (56.04), medium vulnerability (51.9), medium susceptibility (28.94), low coping capabilities (81.8), and moderate adaptive capacities (44.97). Tonga's relatively lower vulnerability despite high exposure suggests that while coping capabilities are limited, adaptive capacities are comparatively stronger than in other regions.\n\n\n**Philippines (2011):** The Philippines in 2011 displayed a very high WRI (24.32), very high exposure (45.09), high vulnerability (53.93), high susceptibility (34.99), low coping capabilities (82.78), and moderate adaptive capacities (44.01). Similar to Guatemala, the Philippines shows high exposure and vulnerability, highlighting the need for improved coping and adaptive capacities.\n\n\n**Vanuatu (2011):** Vanuatu in 2011 recorded a very high WRI (32.0), very high exposure (56.33), high vulnerability (56.81), high susceptibility (37.14), low coping capabilities (79.34), and moderate adaptive capacities (53.96).  Vanuatu's vulnerability is high, mirroring the pattern of high exposure and limited coping and adaptive capacities seen in other regions."
