        "response": "Here's an analysis of the provided data, presented as requested:\n\n\n**Singapur (2011):**  In 2011, Singapur had a very low Water Risk Index (WRI) of 2.85, despite a relatively high exposure score of 9.21, indicating minimal climate-related water stress.  Its vulnerability was rated very low at 30.97, composed of a very low susceptibility (14.6) and relatively high lack of coping (47.37) and adaptive capacities (30.94).  This suggests that while Singapore faces minimal climate-related water exposure, existing coping and adaptive mechanisms may need strengthening.\n\n\n**Frankreich (2011):**  France in 2011 exhibited a very low WRI (2.76) and vulnerability (28.6), with very low exposure (9.64) and susceptibility (15.45).  The lack of coping (42.23) and adaptive capacities (28.11) were also relatively low, indicating a strong overall resilience to water stress despite slightly higher exposure compared to Singapore.\n\n\n**Oman (2011):**  Oman in 2011 showed a very low WRI (2.8), but a low vulnerability score (43.6), driven by a low susceptibility (21.08) and significantly higher lack of coping (60.82) and adaptive capacities (48.91) compared to other countries.  While exposure (6.41) was very low, the high lack of coping and adaptive capacities suggest a higher risk despite the low overall WRI.\n\n\n**Litauen (2011):**  Lithuania in 2011 had a very low WRI (2.89) and very low exposure (8.39), yet a very low vulnerability (34.43) with a low susceptibility (19.58).  Its lack of coping (49.53) and adaptive capacities (34.19) were relatively high, similar to Oman, indicating potential vulnerabilities despite the low WRI.\n\n\n**D\u00e4nemark (2011):** Denmark in 2011 displayed a very low WRI (2.86) and vulnerability (27.16) with low exposure (10.53) and very low susceptibility (14.56).  The lack of coping (39.82) and adaptive capacities (27.11) were also low, indicating strong resilience to water stress despite moderately higher exposure."
