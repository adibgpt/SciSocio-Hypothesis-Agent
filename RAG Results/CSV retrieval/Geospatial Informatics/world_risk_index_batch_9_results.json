        "response": "Here's an analysis of the provided data, presented as requested:\n\n\n**Guinea (2011):**  In Guinea during 2011, the Water Risk Index (WRI) was 9.49 (High category), indicating high water risk, coupled with medium exposure (13.35) and extremely high vulnerability (71.13), primarily driven by very high susceptibility (58.49), a significant lack of coping capabilities (92.13), and a substantial lack of adaptive capacities (62.79).  This suggests Guinea faced severe water insecurity issues in 2011 due to a combination of moderate environmental pressures and extremely weak societal resilience.\n\n\n**Uzbekistan (2011):**  Uzbekistan in 2011 exhibited a high Water Risk Index (WRI) of 9.37, high exposure (17.28), and high vulnerability (54.25).  This vulnerability stemmed from medium susceptibility (33.17), high lack of coping capabilities (77.07), and moderate lack of adaptive capacities (52.51).  Despite high exposure, Uzbekistan's vulnerability was lower than several other countries listed, suggesting potentially better adaptive strategies or coping mechanisms, although still significant water risk concerns.\n\n\n**Cape Verde (2011):**  Cape Verde in 2011 showed a high Water Risk Index (WRI) of 9.47,  high exposure (17.25), and high vulnerability (54.86). This high vulnerability was influenced by high susceptibility (39.52), high lack of coping capabilities (76.86), and relatively low lack of adaptive capacities (48.2).  While facing high exposure, Cape Verde's vulnerability was comparable to Uzbekistan, highlighting the complex interplay between exposure and capacity to adapt to water stress.\n\n\n**Zimbabwe (2011):** In Zimbabwe during 2011, the high Water Risk Index (WRI) of 9.63 reflected high exposure (14.3) and very high vulnerability (67.33). This very high vulnerability was a result of very high susceptibility (55.7), high lack of coping capabilities (89.03), and moderate lack of adaptive capacities (57.26). Zimbabwe experienced severe water insecurity in 2011, characterized by a combination of environmental stressors and limited capacity to cope or adapt.\n\n\n**Mauritania (2011):** Mauritania in 2011 had a high Water Risk Index (WRI) of 9.7, high exposure (14.57), and very high vulnerability (66.59). This very high vulnerability was attributed to high susceptibility (49.0), high lack of coping capabilities (85.79), and substantial lack of adaptive capacities (64.99). Similar to Zimbabwe, Mauritania faced significant water insecurity challenges in 2011 due to a combination of high exposure and low resilience."
