        "response": "Here's an analysis of the provided data, formatted as requested.  Note that because the data is for a single country (Afghanistan) over a short time period,  there are limited insights to be drawn from relationships between features.  The analysis focuses on temporal changes within the provided data.\n\n**Row 1 (Year 2000):**  In 2000, Afghanistan (country code AFG) had an SDG index score of 36, with scores of 28.8 for Goal 1, 27.3 for Goal 2, 19.2 for Goal 3, 1.6 for Goal 4, 20.8 for Goal 5, 32.4 for Goal 6, 21 for Goal 7, 38.5 for Goal 8, 5.2 for Goal 9, 0 for Goal 10, 25.8 for Goal 11, 94.7 for Goal 12, 99.4 for Goal 13, 0 for Goal 14, 51.9 for Goal 15, 39.2 for Goal 16, and 34.2 for Goal 17; this indicates relatively low performance across several SDGs, particularly Goals 4, 9, 10, and 14, while Goals 12 and 13 show much higher scores.\n\n**Row 2 (Year 2001):** In 2001, Afghanistan (AFG) showed a slightly improved SDG index score of 36.3 compared to the previous year, with some minor variations in goal-specific scores;  Goal 2 and Goal 7 saw slight increases, while Goal 3 saw a slight improvement.  The overall SDG index score remained relatively low, suggesting limited progress across most SDGs.\n\n**Row 3 (Year 2002):**  In 2002, Afghanistan (AFG) maintained a similar SDG index score of 36.3 as in 2001, with continued minor fluctuations in individual goal scores.  The data suggests stagnation in overall SDG progress.\n\n**Row 4 (Year 2003):** In 2003, Afghanistan (AFG) experienced a slight increase in its SDG index score to 36.7, primarily driven by improvements in Goal 2 and Goal 3 scores; this represents a marginal improvement compared to previous years.\n\n**Row 5 (Year 2004):** In 2004, Afghanistan (AFG) recorded a further slight increase in its SDG index score to 37.1. While several goals show minor improvements (Goal 2, Goal 3, Goal 7), many remain consistently low.  The overall trend indicates slow but consistent incremental progress in the SDG index score between 2000 and 2004."
