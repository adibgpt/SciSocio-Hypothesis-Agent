        "response": "Here's an analysis of the provided data, presented as requested:\n\n**Row 1 (Year 2008):**  In 2008, Afghanistan (AFG) achieved an SDG index score of 37.3, indicating a relatively low level of progress across the Sustainable Development Goals.  Specifically, Goal 1 (No Poverty) scored 28.8, Goal 2 (Zero Hunger) scored 37.8, Goal 3 (Good Health and Well-being) scored 25.9, Goal 4 (Quality Education) scored a very low 1.6, Goal 5 (Gender Equality) scored 21, Goal 6 (Clean Water and Sanitation) scored 35.7, Goal 7 (Affordable and Clean Energy) scored a low 14.2, Goal 8 (Decent Work and Economic Growth) scored 38.5, Goal 9 (Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure) scored a low 5.2, Goal 10 (Reduced Inequalities) scored 0, Goal 11 (Sustainable Cities and Communities) scored 28, Goal 12 (Responsible Consumption and Production) scored a high 96.3, Goal 13 (Climate Action) scored a high 99.2, Goal 14 (Life Below Water) scored 0, Goal 15 (Life On Land) scored 51.8, Goal 16 (Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions) scored 39.2, and Goal 17 (Partnerships for the Goals) scored 36.  This suggests significant challenges in education, energy access, and inequality, while progress is evident in areas like responsible consumption and climate action.\n\n\n**Row 2 (Year 2005):** In 2005, Afghanistan (AFG) had an SDG index score of 37.5, slightly higher than in 2008.  The scores for Goals 1-17 were: 28.8, 35.9, 22.6, 1.6, 20.8, 33.6, 27.4, 38.4, 5.2, 0, 26.9, 95.7, 99.4, 0, 51.8, 39.2, and 34.2 respectively.  Similar to 2008, significant challenges were observed in education, inequality, and several other goals.  However,  some goals like Goal 7 (Affordable and Clean Energy) showed relatively better performance compared to 2008.\n\n**Row 3 (Year 2007):**  Afghanistan (AFG) in 2007 showed an SDG index score of 38, a slight improvement over 2005.  The scores for Goals 1-17 were: 28.8, 39.5, 24.4, 1.6, 21, 34.6, 27.6, 38.5, 5.2, 0, 27.6, 96.2, 99.3, 0, 51.8, 39.2, and 34.8 respectively.  The pattern of challenges and progress remained consistent, with Goal 2 (Zero Hunger) showing improvement.\n\n**Row 4 (Year 2009):** In 2009, Afghanistan (AFG) recorded an SDG index score of 38.3, the highest among the years provided. The scores for Goals 1-17 were: 28.8, 43, 28.1, 1.6, 20.8, 36.9, 15.4, 38.5, 5.4, 0, 30.3, 96.6, 99.1, 0, 53, 39.9, and 36.7 respectively.  While Goal 2 (Zero Hunger) showed substantial improvement, Goal 7 (Affordable and Clean Energy) and Goal 15 (Life on Land) showed some progress, while Goal 4 (Quality Education) remained critically low.\n\n\n**Row 5 (Year 2006):**  Afghanistan (AFG) in 2006 had an SDG index score of 37.6.  The scores for Goals 1-17 were: 28.8, 36.5, 22.7, 1.6, 20.8, 33.9, 27.5, 38.5, 5.2, 0, 27.3, 95.9, 99.3, 0, 51.8, 39.2, and 34.7 respectively. The data shows a consistent pattern of low scores in education, inequality, and some other areas, similar to other years.\n\n\n**Summary:** Across all years (2005-2009), Afghanistan consistently faced significant challenges in achieving several SDGs, particularly in education (Goal 4), inequality (Goal 10), and access to clean energy (Goal 7).  While some progress is observed in certain goals like Zero Hunger (Goal 2) and Life on Land (Goal 15) over time, the overall SDG index score remains relatively low, indicating a persistent need for substantial improvements across multiple sectors.  The consistently high scores in Goals 12 and 13 suggest relative strengths in responsible consumption and climate action."
