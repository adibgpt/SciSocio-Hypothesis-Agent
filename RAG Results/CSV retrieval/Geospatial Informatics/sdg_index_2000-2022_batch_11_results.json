        "response": "Here's an analysis of the provided data, presented as requested:\n\n\n**Row 1 (Year 2007):**  In 2007, Algeria (country code DZA) achieved an SDG index score of 68.3, indicating a relatively high level of progress across the Sustainable Development Goals.  Notably, Goal 1 (No Poverty) scored exceptionally high at 95.4, while Goal 9 (Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure) lagged significantly at 20.2, suggesting a disparity in progress across different development areas.  Goal 2 (Zero Hunger) scored moderately at 52.8.  Other goals showed varied levels of attainment.  Overall, Algeria demonstrated strong performance in some areas but considerable room for improvement in others.\n\n\n**Row 2 (Year 2004):**  Algeria's (DZA) SDG index score in 2004 was 67.2, slightly lower than in 2007.  Similar to 2007, Goal 1 (No Poverty) remained exceptionally high at 95.4, while Goal 9 (Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure) scored poorly at 19.6. Goal 2 (Zero Hunger) scored lower in 2004 (47.4) compared to 2007.  The relatively consistent high score for Goal 1 contrasts with the consistently low score for Goal 9, indicating persistent challenges in industrial development.\n\n\n**Row 3 (Year 2005):**  In 2005, Algeria (DZA) showed a slight improvement in its SDG index score to 67.7, compared to 2004.  Goal 1 (No Poverty) again scored 95.4.  Goal 2 (Zero Hunger) remained at 47.4, unchanged from the previous year. Goal 4 (Quality Education) showed improvement from 77.1 in 2004 to 80.3 in 2005.  The consistent high score for Goal 1 and low scores for Goal 2 and 9 suggest ongoing development priorities.\n\n\n**Row 4 (Year 2008):**  Algeria's (DZA) SDG index score in 2008 was 68.3, similar to 2007.  Goal 1 (No Poverty) consistently scored 95.4. Goal 2 (Zero Hunger) showed a modest improvement to 51.3, compared to previous years. Goal 9 (Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure) saw a small increase to 20.4, still representing a significant area for improvement. The continued high score for Goal 1 highlights consistent success in poverty reduction while the low score for Goal 9 persists.\n\n\n**Row 5 (Year 2006):**  In 2006, Algeria (DZA) achieved an SDG index score of 68.4, the highest among the years provided.  Goal 1 (No Poverty) scored its usual 95.4. Goal 2 (Zero Hunger) increased to 53.7, showing gradual improvement. Goal 9 (Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure) slightly improved to 19.8, remaining a significant area needing attention.  The data suggests steady, albeit slow, progress across several goals."
