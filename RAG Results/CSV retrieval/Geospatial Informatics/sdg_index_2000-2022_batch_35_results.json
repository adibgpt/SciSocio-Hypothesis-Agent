        "response": "Here's an analysis of the provided data, presented as requested:\n\n\n**Row 1 (Year 2013):**  In 2013, Austria (AUT) achieved an SDG index score of 81.5, indicating a relatively high level of progress across the Sustainable Development Goals.  Specifically, Austria scored exceptionally well on Goal 1 (99.6) and Goal 4 (96.1), demonstrating strong performance in poverty reduction and quality education. However, scores were considerably lower for Goal 12 (49.1) and Goal 13 (55.9), highlighting challenges related to responsible consumption and production and climate action.  Goal 14 received a score of 0, suggesting a complete lack of progress in this area (likely related to the limitations of the data collection in this specific area for this country).  This suggests that while Austria excels in several areas, significant improvements are needed in others to achieve overall SDG sustainability.\n\n\n**Row 2 (Year 2010):** In 2010, Austria (AUT) had an SDG index score of 80.4.  Similar to 2013, Austria showed high performance in Goal 1 (99.7) and Goal 4 (96.8),  but lower scores in Goals 12 and 13 (49.2 and 54.9 respectively), along with a 0 score for Goal 14.  Compared to 2013, there's a slight decrease in the overall SDG index score and some minor fluctuations in individual goal scores, indicating relatively stable progress across most SDGs but persistent challenges in specific areas like responsible consumption and climate action.\n\n\n**Row 3 (Year 2012):**  Austria (AUT) in 2012 had an SDG index score of 80.8.  The country maintained high scores in Goal 1 (99.4) and Goal 4 (97.3), demonstrating continued success in poverty reduction and quality education.  Again, Goal 12 (49.0) and Goal 13 (54.6) show comparatively lower scores, indicating ongoing challenges in responsible consumption and climate action and a 0 score for Goal 14. Compared to 2010 and 2013, Austria shows a minor improvement in its overall SDG index score.\n\n\n**Row 4 (Year 2009):**  In 2009, Austria (AUT) achieved an SDG index score of 79.8,  with consistently high scores in Goal 1 (99.7) and Goal 4 (96.6), but lower scores in Goals 12 (49.5) and 13 (55.8), and a score of 0 for Goal 14.  This data reflects a similar pattern to previous years, indicating sustained strength in certain areas and persistent weaknesses in others.\n\n\n**Row 5 (Year 2011):**  Austria (AUT)'s SDG index score in 2011 was 80.6.  The country exhibited high scores in Goal 1 (99.5) and Goal 4 (96.9), while Goal 12 (49.0) and Goal 13 (53.8) showed relatively lower scores, and Goal 14 remained at 0.  This data is consistent with previous years, revealing a consistent pattern of strengths and weaknesses across different SDGs."
