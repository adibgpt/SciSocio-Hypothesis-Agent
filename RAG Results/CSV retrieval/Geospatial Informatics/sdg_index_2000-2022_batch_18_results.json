        "response": "Here's an analysis of the provided data, presented as requested:\n\n\n**Row 1 (Year 2019):**  In 2019, Angola (AGO) achieved an SDG Index score of 50.7, indicating a moderate level of progress across the Sustainable Development Goals.  Specifically, Angola scored 34.1 on Goal 1 (No Poverty), 56.2 on Goal 2 (Zero Hunger), 35.3 on Goal 3 (Good Health and Well-being), 42.2 on Goal 4 (Quality Education), 49.8 on Goal 5 (Gender Equality), 54.1 on Goal 6 (Clean Water and Sanitation), 43.1 on Goal 7 (Affordable and Clean Energy), 57.6 on Goal 8 (Decent Work and Economic Growth), 13.6 on Goal 9 (Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure), 16.5 on Goal 10 (Reduced Inequalities), 43.2 on Goal 11 (Sustainable Cities and Communities), 94.1 on Goal 12 (Responsible Consumption and Production), 96.2 on Goal 13 (Climate Action), 67.7 on Goal 14 (Life Below Water), 66.2 on Goal 15 (Life On Land), 42.6 on Goal 16 (Peace, Justice, and Strong Institutions), and 49.8 on Goal 17 (Partnerships for the Goals).  This reveals significant disparities in performance across different SDGs, with particularly strong performance in Goals 12 and 13, and weaker performance in Goals 1, 9, and 10.\n\n\n**Row 2 (Year 2016):** In 2016, Angola (AGO) had a slightly higher SDG Index score of 52.1 compared to 2019, suggesting a potential decline in overall progress.  The breakdown shows scores of 47.6 (Goal 1), 58.1 (Goal 2), 32.7 (Goal 3), 42.2 (Goal 4), 53.1 (Goal 5), 52.9 (Goal 6), 34.9 (Goal 7), 58.9 (Goal 8), 13.1 (Goal 9), 39.4 (Goal 10), 44.2 (Goal 11), 94.1 (Goal 12), 94.4 (Goal 13), 68.6 (Goal 14), 67.1 (Goal 15), 42.6 (Goal 16), and 42.6 (Goal 17).  Similar to 2019, Goals 12 and 13 show strong performance, while Goals 1 and 9 remain relatively weak.  Goal 10 shows a notable difference compared to 2019.\n\n\n**Row 3 (Year 2020):** Angola's (AGO) SDG Index score in 2020 was 50.8, very close to 2019, indicating relatively stagnant progress. The individual goal scores were: 31.1 (Goal 1), 55.1 (Goal 2), 35.1 (Goal 3), 42.2 (Goal 4), 49.8 (Goal 5), 54.3 (Goal 6), 43.6 (Goal 7), 58.7 (Goal 8), 13.5 (Goal 9), 16.5 (Goal 10), 43.2 (Goal 11), 94.1 (Goal 12), 96.3 (Goal 13), 67.5 (Goal 14), 66.2 (Goal 15), 44 (Goal 16), and 51.9 (Goal 17).  The pattern of strong performance in Goals 12 and 13 and weak performance in Goals 1 and 9 continues, with minimal change across the years.\n\n\n**Row 4 (Year 2017):**  Angola (AGO) in 2017 recorded an SDG Index score of 52.1, similar to 2016.  The goal scores were: 44.2 (Goal 1), 57.5 (Goal 2), 33 (Goal 3), 42.2 (Goal 4), 49.9 (Goal 5), 53.5 (Goal 6), 36.5 (Goal 7), 58.9 (Goal 8), 13.6 (Goal 9), 39.4 (Goal 10), 44.5 (Goal 11), 94 (Goal 12), 94.9 (Goal 13), 69.3 (Goal 14), 67.1 (Goal 15), 42.6 (Goal 16), and 43.8 (Goal 17).  Again, Goals 12 and 13 show consistently high scores, while progress on Goals 1 and 9 remains limited.  Goal 10 shows a significant difference from 2019 and 2020.\n\n\n**Row 5 (Year 2018):** In 2018, Angola (AGO) had an SDG Index score of 50.9. The individual goal scores were: 38.4 (Goal 1), 57.1 (Goal 2), 34.4 (Goal 3), 42.2 (Goal 4), 49.9 (Goal 5), 54 (Goal 6), 41.3 (Goal 7), 59 (Goal 8), 12.8 (Goal 9), 16.5 (Goal 10), 43.2 (Goal 11), 94.1 (Goal 12), 96 (Goal 13), 67.4 (Goal 14), 66.2 (Goal 15), 43 (Goal 16), and 50.3 (Goal 17).  The consistent strength in Goals 12 and 13 and weakness in Goals 1 and 9 persists, with Goal 10 showing a notable difference again compared to other years.\n\n\nOverall, the data suggests a relatively stable but moderate level of progress across the SDGs in Angola between 2016 and 2020, with consistent strong performance in environmental goals (Goals 12 and 13) and persistent challenges in poverty reduction (Goal 1) and infrastructure development (Goal 9).  Significant fluctuations are observed in Goal 10 (Reduced Inequalities) across the years."
