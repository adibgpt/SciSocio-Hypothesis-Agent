        "response": "Here's an analysis of the provided data, presented as requested:\n\n**Benin (2013):**  In Benin in 2013, the Water Risk Index (WRI) was very high at 11.32, reflecting high exposure (17.06) and extremely high vulnerability (66.34), driven by very high susceptibility (53.29), a significant lack of coping capabilities (82.2), and a substantial lack of adaptive capacities (63.54).  This indicates a very high risk of water-related challenges in Benin, highlighting the need for substantial improvements in adaptive and coping mechanisms.\n\n**Dominikanische Republik (2013):** In the Dominican Republic in 2013, despite a very high WRI (11.28) and very high exposure (23.14), the vulnerability was categorized as medium (48.74) due to medium susceptibility (28.31), high lack of coping capabilities (73.06), and moderate lack of adaptive capacities (44.86). This suggests that while exposure is high, existing coping and adaptive mechanisms partially mitigate the overall vulnerability.\n\n**Guyana (2013):**  Guyana in 2013 showed a very high WRI (11.65) with very high exposure (22.9), but a medium vulnerability score (50.87) resulting from medium susceptibility (28.69), high lack of coping capabilities (79.37), and moderate lack of adaptive capacities (44.54).  Similar to the Dominican Republic, this suggests that while exposure is significant,  existing infrastructure or societal resilience partially buffers against the full impact of water risks.\n\n**Kamerun (2013):** In Cameroon in 2013, a very high WRI (11.23) combined with very high exposure (18.19) resulted in high vulnerability (61.71) stemming from high susceptibility (41.3), very high lack of coping capabilities (84.97), and high lack of adaptive capacities (58.87). This indicates a considerable risk of water-related problems, requiring significant attention to improve both coping and adaptive capacities.\n\n**Niger (2013):** Niger in 2013 experienced a very high WRI (11.62) with high exposure (15.87) leading to very high vulnerability (73.21), caused by very high susceptibility (61.26), extremely high lack of coping capabilities (86.62), and high lack of adaptive capacities (71.76). This represents a critically high risk of water-related issues, demanding urgent and substantial interventions to improve resilience."
