        "response": "Here's an analysis of the provided data, presented as requested:\n\n\n**Bolivia (2011):**  In Bolivia in 2011, the Water Risk Index (WRI) was 5.16 (categorized as low), despite a very low exposure score of 9.34.  However, the country exhibited high vulnerability (55.23), driven by high susceptibility (43.45), a significant lack of coping capabilities (80.64), and a moderate lack of adaptive capacities (41.61).  This suggests that while the exposure to water-related risks is low, Bolivia's inherent vulnerabilities and limited capacity to cope with or adapt to such risks pose a significant challenge.\n\n\n**Turkey (2011):** In Turkey in 2011, a low WRI of 5.38 reflected low exposure (11.81) and medium vulnerability (45.57). This vulnerability was characterized by low susceptibility (21.41), moderate lack of coping capabilities (68.14), and moderate lack of adaptive capacities (47.15).  Despite relatively low exposure, Turkey's moderate vulnerability indicates a need for attention to its coping and adaptive capacities to mitigate potential water risks.\n\n\n**Lebanon (2011):** In Lebanon during 2011, a low WRI of 5.01 resulted from low exposure (11.12) and low overall vulnerability (45.03). This low vulnerability stemmed from low susceptibility (21.05), relatively high lack of coping capabilities (70.28), and moderate lack of adaptive capacities (43.75).  Lebanon's low vulnerability despite relatively high lack of coping capabilities suggests that other factors, such as low exposure and susceptibility, are mitigating the overall water risk.\n\n\n**Iran (2011):** In Iran in 2011, the low WRI of 5.11 was influenced by low exposure (10.4) and medium vulnerability (49.07).  This medium vulnerability was a result of low susceptibility (21.48), a high lack of coping capabilities (80.01), and moderate lack of adaptive capacities (45.73). Similar to Bolivia, Iran shows that even with low exposure, high lack of coping capabilities can contribute to a moderate vulnerability level.\n\n\n**Jordan (2011):**  In Jordan in 2011, the low WRI (5.13) was a consequence of low exposure (11.5) and low vulnerability (44.61).  This low vulnerability was composed of medium susceptibility (24.18), moderate lack of coping capabilities (67.33), and moderate lack of adaptive capacities (42.33).  Jordan's relatively low vulnerability suggests that despite moderate challenges in coping and adaptation, the overall water risk remains low due to low exposure and susceptibility."
