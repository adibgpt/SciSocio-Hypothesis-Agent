        "response": "Here's an analysis of the provided data, presented as requested:\n\n\n**Algeria (DZA):**  Algeria, located in the MENA region, achieved an overall score of 70.83, with high scores in Goal 1 (97.67) and Goal 10 (97.02), suggesting strong performance in those areas, while relatively lower scores in Goal 5 (41.04) and Goal 9 (53.87) indicate areas needing improvement.  This suggests a mixed performance across the 17 goals, with strengths in some areas and significant weaknesses in others.\n\n\n**T\u00fcrkiye (TUR):** T\u00fcrkiye, an OECD country, scored 70.78 overall, demonstrating high performance in Goal 1 (98.13) and Goal 4 (89.42), but comparatively lower scores in Goal 10 (45.03) and Goal 15 (53.87) highlight potential areas for focus.  The relatively balanced scores across other goals suggest a consistent, though not exceptional, performance across most sustainable development goals.\n\n\n**Ecuador (ECU):** Ecuador, situated in the LAC region, received an overall score of 70.43.  While showing strong performance in Goal 4 (90.55) and Goal 13 (92.68), it exhibits a notably lower score in Goal 10 (22.11), indicating a significant disparity in achievement across different goals. This highlights a need for targeted interventions to address the significant underperformance in certain areas.\n\n\n**Indonesia (IDN):** Indonesia, from the East & South Asia region, achieved an overall score of 70.16.  High scores in Goal 4 (92.18) and Goal 13 (92.50) contrast with lower scores in Goal 9 (50.66) and Goal 17 (52.39), revealing a similar pattern to other countries of strong performance in some areas and significant weakness in others. This suggests a need for focused efforts to improve performance in specific areas.\n\n\n**El Salvador (SLV):** El Salvador, also in the LAC region, obtained an overall score of 70.66.  It shows strong performance in Goal 1 (93.99) and Goal 13 (94.84), but significantly lower scores in Goal 9 (37.59) and Goal 14 (43.61) point to considerable room for improvement in specific sustainable development areas.  This uneven performance highlights a need for strategic resource allocation."
