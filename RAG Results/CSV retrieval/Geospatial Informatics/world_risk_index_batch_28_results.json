        "response": "Here's an analysis of the provided data, presented as requested:\n\n\n**Libyen (2011):**  In Libya in 2011,  a low Water Risk Index (WRI) of 3.67, despite very low exposure (7.53), was coupled with a medium vulnerability (48.74) stemming from high susceptibility (24.12), lack of coping capabilities (73.53), and lack of adaptive capacities (48.57).  This suggests that despite low exposure to climate hazards, Libya's significant lack of coping and adaptive capacities contributed to a considerably higher vulnerability than expected.\n\n**Portugal (2011):** In Portugal in 2011, low exposure (11.02) and a low WRI (3.62) resulted in very low vulnerability (32.85) due to low susceptibility (17.34), relatively low lack of coping capabilities (49.78), and low lack of adaptive capacities (31.43). This indicates that Portugal's lower vulnerability reflects its better preparedness and adaptive capacities compared to other regions.\n\n**Russische F\u00f6deration (2011):**  The Russian Federation in 2011 exhibited very low exposure (9.07) and a very low WRI (3.56), leading to low vulnerability (39.27) characterized by low susceptibility (19.88), moderate lack of coping capabilities (59.48), and moderate lack of adaptive capacities (38.45).  While exposure was low,  the moderate lack of coping and adaptive capacities still contributed to a noticeable level of vulnerability.\n\n**Belgien (2011):** In Belgium in 2011, low exposure (11.82) and a very low WRI (3.51) resulted in very low vulnerability (29.66), reflecting very low susceptibility (15.03) and low levels of lack of coping capabilities (42.05) and lack of adaptive capacities (31.92). This suggests that Belgium possessed robust coping and adaptive mechanisms, leading to a low vulnerability despite moderate exposure.\n\n**Vereinigtes K\u00f6nigreich (2011):** The United Kingdom in 2011 showed low exposure (11.61) and a low WRI (3.61), contributing to very low vulnerability (31.11) due to very low susceptibility (15.51), and moderate lack of coping capabilities (47.55) and lack of adaptive capacities (30.25). Similar to Belgium, the UK demonstrates effective coping and adaptive mechanisms mitigating vulnerability despite some exposure."
