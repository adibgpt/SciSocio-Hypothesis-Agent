        "response": "Here's an analysis of the provided data, presented as requested:\n\n\n**Row 1 (Year 2015):**  In 2015, Albania (ALB) achieved an SDG index score of 70.9, indicating a relatively high level of progress across various sustainable development goals.  Specifically, Albania scored notably high in Goal 1 (96.7), Goal 4 (93.6), and Goal 13 (91.1), suggesting strong performance in poverty reduction, quality education, and climate action. However, lower scores were observed in Goal 2 (50.2), Goal 5 (51.5), Goal 9 (35.8), and Goal 14 (43.1), highlighting areas needing improvement in zero hunger, gender equality, industry innovation, and life below water. This suggests a need for focused interventions in these specific areas to achieve more balanced and comprehensive sustainable development.\n\n\n**Row 2 (Year 2013):**  Albania's 2013 SDG index score was 70.6, slightly lower than in 2015.  While strong performance continued in areas such as Goal 1 (94.3) and Goal 3 (80.1) (no poverty and good health),  Goal 4 (90.2) showed some improvement compared to 2015,  and Goal 10 (93.6) was exceptionally high, indicating significant progress in reduced inequalities.  However, similar to 2015,  lower scores persisted in Goal 5 (48.3) and Goal 9 (33.1), highlighting ongoing challenges related to gender equality and industry, innovation, and infrastructure.  The data suggests that while progress was made, persistent inequalities and developmental gaps remained.\n\n\n**Row 3 (Year 2016):** In 2016, Albania (ALB) saw a slight increase in its SDG index score to 71.1, demonstrating continued, albeit incremental, progress toward sustainable development.  High scores in Goal 1 (96.5) and Goal 4 (96.5) again indicated strong performance in poverty reduction and quality education, while Goal 5 (53.7) showed some improvement in gender equality compared to previous years.  However,  Goal 9 (35.0) and Goal 14 (44.5) remained relatively low, indicating the continued need for targeted interventions in industry, innovation, and marine conservation. This suggests a consistent pattern of strong performance in some areas and persistent challenges in others.\n\n\n**Row 4 (Year 2014):**  Albania's SDG index score in 2014 was 69.6, representing a slight dip compared to 2013 and 2015.  While scores in Goal 1 (92.0), Goal 3 (80.4), and Goal 4 (93.1) remained relatively high, indicating continued progress in poverty reduction, health, and education,  Goal 9 (34.0) and Goal 14 (44.6) continued to lag.  Goal 7 (81.1) shows a decline compared to previous years suggesting a potential setback in affordable and clean energy.  The data suggests that while progress is being made in some areas, certain challenges persist, requiring sustained effort.\n\n\n**Row 5 (Year 2012):** In 2012, Albania (ALB) had an SDG index score of 70.7.  While showing strong performance in Goal 1 (95.9), Goal 3 (81.2), and Goal 10 (93.6), indicating success in poverty reduction, good health and well-being and reduced inequalities respectively,  Goal 9 (30.9) and Goal 5 (46.1) were considerably lower, highlighting persistent challenges related to industry and gender equality. Goal 4 (87.7) was lower than subsequent years, suggesting improvements in education over time. The data showcases a pattern of high scores in some areas and consistently low scores in others, indicating a need for targeted policies and programs."
