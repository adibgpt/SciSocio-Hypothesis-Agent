        "response": "Here's an analysis of the provided data, presented as requested:\n\n\n**Kanada (2011):**  In 2011, Kanada had a very low Water Risk Index (WRI) of 2.57,  a very low exposure score of 9.08, and a very low vulnerability score of 28.32, which comprised a very low susceptibility of 14.04, a lack of coping capabilities of 44.58, and a lack of adaptive capacities of 26.35.  This suggests that despite relatively high lack of coping capabilities, Kanada's overall risk profile was very low due to low exposure and vulnerability.\n\n**Seychellen (2011):** In 2011, Seychellen exhibited a very low WRI of 2.68 and very low exposure (6.09), but a low vulnerability score of 43.97, resulting from a low susceptibility (21.16), a high lack of coping capabilities (71.65), and a high lack of adaptive capacities (39.1).  Despite low exposure, Seychellen's high lack of coping and adaptive capacities significantly elevated its vulnerability compared to Kanada.\n\n**Luxemburg (2011):**  Luxemburg in 2011 showed a very low WRI of 2.7, a low exposure score of 10.09, and a very low vulnerability score of 26.78,  comprising a very low susceptibility of 11.92, a moderately high lack of coping capabilities (39.99), and a moderately high lack of adaptive capacities (28.43).  Similar to Kanada, Luxemburg's low exposure and vulnerability resulted in a low overall risk, despite moderate levels of lacking coping and adaptive capacities.\n\n**Israel (2011):** In 2011, Israel presented a very low WRI of 2.6, very low exposure (7.13), and a low vulnerability score of 36.44, stemming from a low susceptibility (18.4), a high lack of coping capabilities (56.2), and a moderately high lack of adaptive capacities (34.73).  Israel's high lack of coping capabilities contributed to a relatively higher vulnerability than Luxemburg or Kanada despite similar exposure levels.\n\n\n**Schweiz (2011):** In 2011, Schweiz had a very low WRI of 2.55, a low exposure score of 9.96, and a very low vulnerability score of 25.57, which consisted of a very low susceptibility (14.27), a moderately high lack of coping capabilities (36.89), and a moderately high lack of adaptive capacities (25.56).  Similar to Kanada and Luxemburg, Schweiz's low exposure and vulnerability resulted in a low overall risk profile, despite moderate levels of lacking coping and adaptive capacities."
