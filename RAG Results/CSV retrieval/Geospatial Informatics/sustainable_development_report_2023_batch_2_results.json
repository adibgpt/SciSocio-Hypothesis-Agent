        "response": "Here's an analysis of the provided data, presented as requested:\n\n\n**Czechia (CZE):**  Czechia, an OECD country, achieved an overall score of 81.87,  with high scores in Goal 1 (99.90), Goal 3 (90.15), Goal 4 (93.87), Goal 10 (100), and Goal 11 (94.52), indicating strong performance in these areas. However, lower scores were observed in Goal 2 (62.05), Goal 5 (74.32), Goal 12 (62.78), and Goal 17 (68.56), suggesting areas needing improvement.  The relatively high overall score, despite some lower goal scores, points to a balanced, yet uneven, progress across the Sustainable Development Goals.\n\n\n**France (FRA):** France, also an OECD member, obtained an overall score of 82.05, slightly higher than Czechia.  While excelling in Goal 1 (99.73), Goal 4 (99.63), and Goal 9 (92.78),  France showed relatively weaker performances in Goal 2 (72.39), Goal 12 (60.52), and Goal 15 (68.82).  The higher overall score compared to Czechia, despite similar weaknesses in some goals, suggests a stronger performance in other areas.\n\n\n**Norway (NOR):** Norway, another OECD country, scored 82.00, comparable to France.  Norway demonstrates exceptional performance in Goal 7 (98.54), Goal 10 (99.41), and Goal 17 (94.03), while displaying significant room for improvement in Goal 2 (60.79), Goal 12 (39.78), and Goal 13 (20.68).  The high overall score is driven by strong performance in several goals, but significant disparities exist, particularly in environmental goals.\n\n\n**Poland (POL):** Poland, an OECD country, received an overall score of 81.80, similar to Czechia.  Poland showcases relatively strong performance across most goals, including Goal 1 (99.04), Goal 4 (97.45), Goal 12 (74.13), and Goal 15 (92.87), with no exceptionally low scores.  The balanced performance across multiple goals contributes to a relatively high overall score.\n\n\n**Estonia (EST):** Estonia, an OECD country, achieved an overall score of 81.68.  Estonia exhibits strong performance in Goal 1 (99.98), Goal 15 (96.15), and Goal 16 (91.02), but displays weaker performances in Goal 2 (63.18), Goal 12 (52.61), and Goal 13 (61.46).  The relatively high overall score, despite the weaker areas, suggests a generally good performance across the SDGs.\n\n\nNote:  Goal 14 scores are missing for all countries in the provided data."
