        "response": "Here's an analysis of each row, following the requested format:\n\n\n**Row 1: Turkey, 2022, Measles**\n\n1. **Column Names and Values:** Country: Turkey, Year: 2022, Disease Name: Measles, Disease Category: Chronic, Prevalence Rate (%): 6.97, Incidence Rate (%): 2.22, Mortality Rate (%): 6.35, Age Group: 36-60, Gender: Male, Population Affected: 534508, Healthcare Access (%): 91.15, Doctors per 1000: 0.62, Hospital Beds per 1000: 5.87, Treatment Type: Vaccination, Average Treatment Cost (USD): 24653, Availability of Vaccines/Treatment: No, Recovery Rate (%): 76.34, DALYs: 2649, Improvement in 5 Years (%): 3.99, Per Capita Income (USD): 17444, Education Index: 0.5, Urbanization Rate (%): 59.77\n\n2. **Descriptive Sentence:** In Turkey in 2022, a chronic measles outbreak affected 534,508 males aged 36-60, exhibiting a 6.97% prevalence, 2.22% incidence, and a concerning 6.35% mortality rate, despite 91.15% healthcare access;  the lack of vaccine availability, coupled with a relatively low doctor-to-patient ratio (0.62 per 1000) and a high average treatment cost ($24,653), resulted in a 76.34% recovery rate and 2649 DALYs, suggesting a need for improved vaccination programs.\n\n3. **Summary Statement:**  Turkey faced a significant measles challenge in 2022, characterized by high mortality despite relatively good healthcare access.  The lack of vaccine availability is a critical factor contributing to the disease burden.\n\n\n**Row 2: Germany, 2017, Cancer**\n\n1. **Column Names and Values:** Country: Germany, Year: 2017, Disease Name: Cancer, Disease Category: Metabolic, Prevalence Rate (%): 3.04, Incidence Rate (%): 2.12, Mortality Rate (%): 4.46, Age Group: 61+, Gender: Male, Population Affected: 639082, Healthcare Access (%): 96.85, Doctors per 1000: 1.99, Hospital Beds per 1000: 2.73, Treatment Type: Medication, Average Treatment Cost (USD): 33639, Availability of Vaccines/Treatment: Yes, Recovery Rate (%): 71.36, DALYs: 3351, Improvement in 5 Years (%): 8.09, Per Capita Income (USD): 20359, Education Index: 0.73, Urbanization Rate (%): 86.25\n\n2. **Descriptive Sentence:** In Germany in 2017,  cancer, categorized as a metabolic disease, affected 639,082 males aged 61 and older, with a 3.04% prevalence, 2.12% incidence, and 4.46% mortality;  despite high healthcare access (96.85%) and available treatments, a 71.36% recovery rate and 3351 DALYs were observed, indicating the significant impact of this disease, even with relatively good healthcare infrastructure.\n\n3. **Summary Statement:**  Germany experienced a substantial cancer burden in 2017 among older men, highlighting the ongoing challenge of this disease even in a high-income country with advanced healthcare.\n\n\n**Row 3: France, 2008, Tuberculosis**\n\n1. **Column Names and Values:** Country: France, Year: 2008, Disease Name: Tuberculosis, Disease Category: Respiratory, Prevalence Rate (%): 4.6, Incidence Rate (%): 4.94, Mortality Rate (%): 2.08, Age Group: 61+, Gender: Female, Population Affected: 215901, Healthcare Access (%): 63.27, Doctors per 1000: 2.44, Hospital Beds per 1000: 0.86, Treatment Type: Therapy, Average Treatment Cost (USD): 35024, Availability of Vaccines/Treatment: Yes, Recovery Rate (%): 73.99, DALYs: 3893, Improvement in 5 Years (%): 0.04, Per Capita Income (USD): 35337, Education Index: 0.49, Urbanization Rate (%): 80.47\n\n2. **Descriptive Sentence:** In France during 2008, tuberculosis, a respiratory disease, impacted 215,901 females aged 61+, showing a 4.6% prevalence and 4.94% incidence with a 2.08% mortality rate; while treatments were available,  the relatively lower healthcare access (63.27%) and a high average treatment cost ($35,024) contributed to a 73.99% recovery rate and 3893 DALYs, suggesting room for improvement in healthcare provision.\n\n3. **Summary Statement:**  France's tuberculosis situation in 2008 indicated a need for enhanced healthcare access and potentially more cost-effective treatment strategies for older women.\n\n\n**Row 4: Mexico, 2006, Dengue**\n\n1. **Column Names and Values:** Country: Mexico, Year: 2006, Disease Name: Dengue, Disease Category: Neurological, Prevalence Rate (%): 5.84, Incidence Rate (%): 6.71, Mortality Rate (%): 0.63, Age Group: 61+, Gender: Other, Population Affected: 999156, Healthcare Access (%): 95.87, Doctors per 1000: 2.02, Hospital Beds per 1000: 5.29, Treatment Type: Therapy, Average Treatment Cost (USD): 47635, Availability of Vaccines/Treatment: Yes, Recovery Rate (%): 90.72, DALYs: 4251, Improvement in 5 Years (%): 3.48, Per Capita Income (USD): 9033, Education Index: 0.42, Urbanization Rate (%): 72.74\n\n2. **Descriptive Sentence:** In Mexico in 2006, a neurological dengue fever outbreak affected 999,156 individuals aged 61+ (gender unspecified), exhibiting a 5.84% prevalence, 6.71% incidence, and a low 0.63% mortality rate;  despite high healthcare access (95.87%) and available treatments, the high average treatment cost ($47,635) and relatively lower per capita income ($9,033) may have contributed to the overall burden.\n\n3. **Summary Statement:**  Mexico's dengue outbreak in 2006, while exhibiting a high recovery rate, highlights the financial burden of treatment within a context of lower per capita income.\n\n\n**Row 5: Indonesia, 2000, Rabies**\n\n1. **Column Names and Values:** Country: Indonesia, Year: 2000, Disease Name: Rabies, Disease Category: Bacterial, Prevalence Rate (%): 1.22, Incidence Rate (%): 13.78, Mortality Rate (%): 3.9, Age Group: 0-18, Gender: Male, Population Affected: 723071, Healthcare Access (%): 56.9, Doctors per 1000: 3.04, Hospital Beds per 1000: 3.53, Treatment Type: Therapy, Average Treatment Cost (USD): 45214, Availability of Vaccines/Treatment: Yes, Recovery Rate (%): 97.84, DALYs: 4746, Improvement in 5 Years (%): 3.3, Per Capita Income (USD): 24147, Education Index: 0.73, Urbanization Rate (%): 79.39\n\n2. **Descriptive Sentence:**  In Indonesia during 2000, a bacterial rabies outbreak primarily affected 723,071 males aged 0-18, showing a 1.22% prevalence and a high 13.78% incidence rate with a 3.9% mortality rate; despite available treatments and a relatively high doctor-to-patient ratio (3.04 per 1000), the lower healthcare access (56.9%) and high average treatment cost ($45,214) still resulted in a significant number of DALYs (4746).\n\n3. **Summary Statement:** Indonesia's rabies outbreak in 2000, while showing a very high recovery rate, underscores the need for improved healthcare access, especially considering the high incidence rate among children."
