        "response": "Here's an analysis of the provided data, presented as requested:\n\n\n**Row 1 (UK, 2022, Ebola):**  In the UK in 2022, an infectious disease, Ebola, affected 757,339 males aged 0-18, exhibiting a 13.47% prevalence rate, a 1.67% incidence rate, and a 7.39% mortality rate, resulting in 1707 DALYs.  Despite a 93.31% recovery rate and available vaccines/treatment, the high prevalence suggests a significant public health challenge, especially considering the relatively low healthcare access (62.94%) and doctor-to-patient ratio (1.86 doctors per 1000).  The average treatment cost was substantial ($22,504).\n\n**Row 2 (Turkey, 2007, Cancer):** In Turkey in 2007, an autoimmune cancer affected 422,894 individuals of unspecified gender, aged 19-35, with an 11.36% prevalence rate, a 6.84% incidence rate, and a low 0.33% mortality rate, resulting in 781 DALYs.  Despite a 72.14% recovery rate and available treatment, the relatively high incidence rate and lower healthcare access (56.41%) compared to other countries indicates a need for improved cancer care, especially considering the lower average treatment cost ($478).\n\n\n**Row 3 (South Korea, 2018, COVID-19):** In South Korea during 2018, the autoimmune disease COVID-19 impacted 130,852 males aged 61 and older, displaying a 5.68% prevalence rate, a 5.18% incidence rate, and a 7.41% mortality rate, resulting in 286 DALYs.  The relatively high recovery rate (69.89%) coupled with high healthcare access (79.45%) and a high number of hospital beds (5.3 per 1000) suggests a robust healthcare system response, despite the significant average treatment cost ($42,881).\n\n\n**Row 4 (Germany, 2009, HIV/AIDS):** In Germany in 2009, a respiratory disease, HIV/AIDS, affected 881,564 females aged 0-18, with a 0.97% prevalence rate, a 3.97% incidence rate, and a 2.22% mortality rate, resulting in 3311 DALYs.  The relatively low prevalence despite a high healthcare access (89.55%) and a high number of doctors (4.04 per 1000) and hospital beds (6.1 per 1000) suggests effective prevention strategies may be lacking, given the unavailability of vaccines/treatment and the lower recovery rate (61.33%).\n\n\n**Row 5 (UK, 2020, Diabetes):** In the UK during 2020, a bacterial disease, Diabetes, affected 140,343 males aged 19-35, demonstrating a 0.64% prevalence rate, a 7.28% incidence rate, and a 1.91% mortality rate, resulting in 2041 DALYs.  Despite a high recovery rate (95.04%), the unavailability of vaccines/treatment and the relatively low healthcare access (53.97%) highlight potential challenges in managing this disease, especially considering the high average treatment cost ($33,721)."
