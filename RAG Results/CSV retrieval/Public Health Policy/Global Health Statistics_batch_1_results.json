despite high healthcare access (89.21%), surgical treatment cost $47,851 on average, with a 4.82% improvement over five years, within the context of a high per capita income ($80,639), a strong education index (0.74), and a 45.52% urbanization rate.\n\n\n3. **Summary Statement:** The high prevalence and mortality of Ebola in France in 2002, despite high healthcare access and a high per capita income, highlight the significant impact of this disease and the need for effective treatment strategies, even in developed nations.\n\n\n**Row 3 (Indonesia, 2011, Parkinson's Disease):**\n\n1. **Column Names and Values:** Country: Indonesia, Year: 2011, Disease Name: Parkinson's Disease, Disease Category: Autoimmune, Prevalence Rate (%): 4.68, Incidence Rate (%): 6.29, Mortality Rate (%): 3.99, Age Group: 0-18, Gender: Other, Population Affected: 446224, Healthcare Access (%): 85.2, Doctors per 1000: 3.18, Hospital Beds per 1000: 8.44, Treatment Type: Surgery, Average Treatment Cost (USD): 144, Availability of Vaccines/Treatment: Yes, Recovery Rate (%): 67.35, DALYs: 3201, Improvement in 5 Years (%): 2.22, Per Capita Income (USD): 49336, Education Index: 0.49, Urbanization Rate (%): 58.47\n\n2. **Descriptive Sentence:** In Indonesia in 2011, Parkinson's disease, an autoimmune disorder, affected 446,224 individuals across all genders aged 0-18, exhibiting a 4.68% prevalence, 6.29% incidence, and 3.99% mortality rate, leading to a 67.35% recovery rate; with substantial healthcare access (85.2%), surgical treatment cost a low $144 on average, resulting in a 2.22% improvement over five years, within a context of a moderate per capita income ($49,336), a moderate education index (0.49), and a high urbanization rate (58.47%).\n\n3. **Summary Statement:** The relatively high prevalence and incidence of Parkinson's disease in Indonesia in 2011, affecting a young population, despite relatively good healthcare access, suggest a need for further research into preventative measures and improved treatment strategies, especially considering the low cost of treatment.\n\n\n**Row 4 (Italy, 2013, Tuberculosis):**\n\n1. **Column Names and Values:** Country: Italy, Year: 2013, Disease Name: Tuberculosis, Disease Category: Genetic, Prevalence Rate (%): 0.83, Incidence Rate (%): 13.59, Mortality Rate (%): 7.01, Age Group: 61+, Gender: Male, Population Affected: 472908, Healthcare Access (%): 67.0, Doctors per 1000: 4.61, Hospital Beds per 1000: 5.9, Treatment Type: Medication, Average Treatment Cost (USD): 8908, Availability of Vaccines/Treatment: Yes, Recovery Rate (%): 50.06, DALYs: 2832, Improvement in 5 Years (%): 6.93, Per Capita Income (USD): 47701, Education Index: 0.5, Urbanization Rate (%): 48.14\n\n2. **Descriptive Sentence:** In Italy during 2013, tuberculosis, a genetic disease, affected 472,908 males aged 61 and older, exhibiting a low prevalence (0.83%) but a high incidence (13.59%) and mortality (7.01%) rate, resulting in a 50.06% recovery rate;
