        "response": "Indonesia, located in Southeast Asia, received a ladder score of 5.568 (with a confidence interval of 5.466 to 5.670), reflecting a relatively low level of happiness compared to other countries in the dataset.  This score is associated with a log GDP per capita of 1.361, social support of 1.184, healthy life expectancy of 0.472, freedom to make life choices of 0.779, generosity of 0.399, perceptions of corruption of 0.055, and a dystopia + residual value of 1.318.  The relatively low ladder score may be influenced by the moderate GDP per capita and lower social support, although a relatively high level of freedom to make life choices is present.\n\nVenezuela, situated in Latin America and the Caribbean, achieved a ladder score of 5.607 (5.489 to 5.725), suggesting a similar level of happiness to Indonesia despite having a significantly lower log GDP per capita of 0.000.  This is counterbalanced by higher social support (1.321) and a considerably higher dystopia + residual value (2.998), potentially indicating other strong contributing factors to overall life satisfaction despite economic hardship.  The low GDP per capita is notable in contrast to the relatively higher social support score.\n\nMontenegro, in Central and Eastern Europe, scored 5.707 (5.599 to 5.815) on the ladder, indicating a slightly higher level of happiness than Indonesia and Venezuela. This score correlates with a log GDP per capita of 1.571, social support of 1.318, healthy life expectancy of 0.587, freedom to make life choices of 0.632, generosity of 0.110, perceptions of corruption of 0.132, and a dystopia + residual of 1.357.  The higher GDP per capita and relatively high social support likely contribute to the higher ladder score.\n\nColombia, also in Latin America and the Caribbean, received a ladder score of 5.695 (5.584 to 5.806), slightly higher than Venezuela and comparable to Montenegro.  This is linked to a log GDP per capita of 1.437, social support of 1.241, healthy life expectancy of 0.648, freedom to make life choices of 0.644, generosity of 0.072, perceptions of corruption of 0.059, and a dystopia + residual of 1.596.  The relatively high healthy life expectancy and moderate GDP per capita likely contribute to the higher ladder score compared to Venezuela.\n\nMongolia, in East Asia, obtained a ladder score of 5.696 (5.610 to 5.783), very similar to Colombia.  This score is associated with a log GDP per capita of 1.353, high social support (1.511), a relatively low healthy life expectancy (0.400), freedom to make life choices of 0.501, generosity of 0.237, perceptions of corruption of 0.055, and a dystopia + residual of 1.640.  The high social support score stands out despite the lower healthy life expectancy, suggesting that social factors significantly influence happiness in Mongolia."
