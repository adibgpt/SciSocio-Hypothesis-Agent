        "response": "Here's an analysis of each row, following the requested format:\n\n\n**Row 1: Brazil, 2013, Ebola**\n\n1. **Column Names and Values:** Country: Brazil, Year: 2013, Disease Name: Ebola, Disease Category: Metabolic, Prevalence Rate (%): 16.01, Incidence Rate (%): 8.55, Mortality Rate (%): 1.35, Age Group: 19-35, Gender: Male, Population Affected: 384573, Healthcare Access (%): 81.59, Doctors per 1000: 3.08, Hospital Beds per 1000: 3.16, Treatment Type: Medication, Average Treatment Cost (USD): 18972, Availability of Vaccines/Treatment: No, Recovery Rate (%): 70.43, DALYs: 3356, Improvement in 5 Years (%): 8.75, Per Capita Income (USD): 14196, Education Index: 0.81, Urbanization Rate (%): 63.55\n\n2. **Descriptive Sentence:** In 2013, Brazil experienced a metabolic disease outbreak of Ebola primarily affecting 384,573 males aged 19-35, with a 16.01% prevalence, 8.55% incidence, and a relatively low 1.35% mortality rate despite the unavailability of vaccines or treatments, resulting in a 70.43% recovery rate and 3356 DALYs; this occurred within a context of 81.59% healthcare access, 3.08 doctors and 3.16 hospital beds per 1000 people, an average treatment cost of $18,972, and an 8.75% improvement over the preceding five years, all within a nation characterized by a $14,196 per capita income, 0.81 education index, and 63.55% urbanization rate.\n\n3. **Summary Statement:** Despite relatively good healthcare access, the Ebola outbreak in Brazil in 2013 highlights the impact of a lack of effective treatment on a significant population, even with a moderate mortality rate.  The relatively high prevalence and incidence rates, coupled with the absence of vaccines, suggest a need for improved disease surveillance and preparedness.\n\n\n**Row 2: China, 2014, Polio**\n\n1. **Column Names and Values:** Country: China, Year: 2014, Disease Name: Polio, Disease Category: Cardiovascular, Prevalence Rate (%): 0.55, Incidence Rate (%): 0.85, Mortality Rate (%): 3.83, Age Group: 36-60, Gender: Female, Population Affected: 123270, Healthcare Access (%): 62.89, Doctors per 1000: 1.19, Hospital Beds per 1000: 1.36, Treatment Type: Vaccination, Average Treatment Cost (USD): 18513, Availability of Vaccines/Treatment: Yes, Recovery Rate (%): 58.47, DALYs: 4739, Improvement in 5 Years (%): 4.47, Per Capita Income (USD): 99993, Education Index: 0.69, Urbanization Rate (%): 26.87\n\n2. **Descriptive Sentence:** In 2014, China saw a cardiovascular disease classification of Polio affecting 123,270 females aged 36-60, with a low prevalence (0.55%), incidence (0.85%), and a 3.83% mortality rate;  the availability of vaccines and treatments contributed to a 58.47% recovery rate and 4739 DALYs; this occurred within a context of 62.89% healthcare access, 1.19 doctors and 1.36 hospital beds per 1000 people, an average treatment cost of $18,513, and a 4.47% improvement over five years, all within a high-income nation ($99,993 per capita), with a 0.69 education index, and a 26.87% urbanization rate.\n\n3. **Summary Statement:**  The relatively low prevalence and incidence of Polio in China in 2014, despite a higher mortality rate than expected, are likely attributable to the availability of vaccines. The lower healthcare access compared to other countries suggests that resource allocation may still need improvement.  The high per capita income contrasts with relatively low healthcare resources.\n\n\n**Row 3: Nigeria, 2010, Diabetes**\n\n1. **Column Names and Values:** Country: Nigeria, Year: 2010, Disease Name: Diabetes, Disease Category: Cardiovascular, Prevalence Rate (%): 18.17, Incidence Rate (%): 6.2, Mortality Rate (%): 2.12, Age Group: 19-35, Gender: Female, Population Affected: 985553, Healthcare Access (%): 88.65, Doctors per 1000: 3.82, Hospital Beds per 1000: 5.76, Treatment Type: Therapy, Average Treatment Cost (USD): 14348, Availability of Vaccines/Treatment: No, Recovery Rate (%): 88.66, DALYs: 1984, Improvement in 5 Years (%): 4.35, Per Capita Income (USD): 45639, Education Index: 0.51, Urbanization Rate (%): 73.39\n\n2. **Descriptive Sentence:** In Nigeria during 2010, a cardiovascular disease, Diabetes, impacted 985,553 females aged 19-35, showing a high prevalence (18.17%), a 6.2% incidence rate, and a 2.12% mortality rate; the lack of vaccines or treatments resulted in an 88.66% recovery rate and 1984 DALYs; this occurred with high healthcare access (88.65%), 3.82 doctors and 5.76 hospital beds per 1000 people, an average treatment cost of $14,348, and a 4.35% improvement over five years, within a nation with a $45,639 per capita income, a 0.51 education index, and a 73.39% urbanization rate.\n\n3. **Summary Statement:** The high prevalence and incidence of Diabetes in Nigeria in 2010, despite a relatively low mortality rate and high healthcare access, underscore the need for effective therapies and preventative measures.  The high recovery rate suggests that treatment, even without specific vaccines, is somewhat effective.\n\n\n**Row 4: Japan, 2017, Tuberculosis**\n\n1. **Column Names and Values:** Country: Japan, Year: 2017, Disease Name: Tuberculosis, Disease Category: Genetic, Prevalence Rate (%): 13.63, Incidence Rate (%): 8.09, Mortality Rate (%): 7.03, Age Group: 36-60, Gender: Male, Population Affected: 633115, Healthcare Access (%): 55.2, Doctors per 1000: 2.62, Hospital Beds per 1000: 4.59, Treatment Type: Medication, Average Treatment Cost (USD): 22954, Availability of Vaccines/Treatment: No, Recovery Rate (%): 66.11, DALYs: 4969, Improvement in 5 Years (%): 0.13, Per Capita Income (USD): 52433, Education Index: 0.41, Urbanization Rate (%): 65.18\n\n2. **Descriptive Sentence:**  In Japan during 2017, a genetic disease, Tuberculosis, affected 633,115 males aged 36-60, exhibiting a 13.63% prevalence, 8.09% incidence, and a notable 7.03% mortality rate;  the absence of vaccines or treatments resulted in a 66.11% recovery rate and 4969 DALYs; this occurred within a context of 55.2% healthcare access, 2.62 doctors and 4.59 hospital beds per 1000 people, an average treatment cost of $22,954, and minimal improvement (0.13%) over five years, all within a nation characterized by a $52,433 per capita income, a 0.41 education index, and a 65.18% urbanization rate.\n\n3. **Summary Statement:** The relatively high mortality rate of Tuberculosis in Japan in 2017, despite a moderate prevalence and the availability of medication, suggests a need for improved treatment strategies or preventative measures. The low improvement rate indicates a lack of progress in addressing this disease.\n\n\n**Row 5: Japan, 2005, Influenza**\n\n1. **Column Names and Values:** Country: Japan, Year: 2005, Disease Name: Influenza, Disease Category: Respiratory, Prevalence Rate (%): 8.6, Incidence Rate (%): 13.42, Mortality Rate (%): 2.32, Age Group: 36-60, Gender: Female, Population Affected: 757834, Healthcare Access (%): 82.86, Doctors per 1000: 2.72, Hospital Beds per 1000: 5.17, Treatment Type: Medication, Average Treatment Cost (USD): 14207, Availability of Vaccines/Treatment: No, Recovery Rate (%): 75.42, DALYs: 2297, Improvement in 5 Years (%): 3.93, Per Capita Income (USD): 22316, Education Index: 0.87, Urbanization Rate (%): 27.89\n\n2. **Descriptive Sentence:** In Japan in 2005, a respiratory illness, Influenza, impacted 757,834 females aged 36-60, showing an 8.6% prevalence, a 13.42% incidence rate, and a 2.32% mortality rate; the absence of specific vaccines or treatments led to a 75.42% recovery rate and 2297 DALYs; this occurred within a context of 82.86% healthcare access, 2.72 doctors and 5.17 hospital beds per 1000 people, an average treatment cost of $14,207, and a 3.93% improvement over five years, all within a nation characterized by a $22,316 per capita income, a high 0.87 education index, and a 27.89% urbanization rate.\n\n3. **Summary Statement:** The relatively high incidence of Influenza in Japan in 2005, despite high healthcare access and a moderate mortality rate, suggests that preventative measures and improved treatment could further reduce the disease's impact.  The moderate recovery rate indicates the effectiveness of available treatments."
