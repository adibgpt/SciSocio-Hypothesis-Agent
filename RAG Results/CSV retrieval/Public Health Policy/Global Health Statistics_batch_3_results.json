        "response": "Here's an analysis of the provided data, presented as requested:\n\n\n**Australia (2020):**  In Australia in 2020, a parasitic Zika disease affected 766,425 males aged 61 and older, exhibiting a 17.27% prevalence rate, a 1.26% incidence rate, and a 7.08% mortality rate;  therapy was available with an average cost of $20,169 USD, resulting in a 58.19% recovery rate and 3731 DALYs.  Despite vaccine/treatment availability and 53.75% healthcare access, supported by 3.15 doctors and 8.49 hospital beds per 1000 people, the high prevalence and mortality rates suggest a significant public health challenge, especially considering the relatively high per capita income ($48,701 USD) and education index (0.83).\n\n\n**Nigeria (2007):** In Nigeria during 2007, an infectious disease, Diabetes, impacted 227,849 females aged 36-60, showing an 8.92% prevalence, 13.19% incidence, and 5.52% mortality; treatment (therapy) was unavailable, leading to a 68.02% recovery rate and 423 DALYs.  Despite high healthcare access (84.41%) the lack of treatment options, coupled with a relatively high per capita income ($60,608 USD), highlights a disparity between economic resources and healthcare provision, particularly given the lower education index (0.61).\n\n\n**Mexico (2009):** In Mexico in 2009, a metabolic disease, Cancer, affected 462,950 males aged 0-18, with a 3.88% prevalence, 10.85% incidence, and 1.85% mortality; vaccination was available at an average cost of $36,202 USD, achieving a 63.54% recovery rate and 2797 DALYs. The relatively high incidence rate and substantial number of affected individuals, despite available vaccines/treatment and  71.06% healthcare access (supported by 4.08 doctors and 6.22 hospital beds per 1000), indicates a significant public health concern requiring further investigation, especially considering the lower per capita income ($30,015 USD).\n\n\n**Canada (2011):** In Canada during 2011, a cardiovascular disease, Leprosy, affected 76,858 females aged 36-60, presenting a 11.15% prevalence, 0.6% incidence, and 2.97% mortality; surgery was available at an average cost of $19,993 USD, resulting in a high 76.16% recovery rate and 4238 DALYs.  While vaccines/treatment were available and a relatively high recovery rate was observed, the lower number of doctors (0.66 per 1000) and hospital beds (1.99 per 1000) compared to other countries, alongside 67.88% healthcare access, suggest potential limitations in healthcare infrastructure despite a reasonably high per capita income ($44,699 USD).\n\n\n**France (2004):** In France in 2004, a bacterial disease, Measles, affected 420,730 males aged 61 and older, showing an 11.4% prevalence rate, a 5.15% incidence rate, and a 7.77% mortality rate; therapy was available at an average cost of $49,545 USD, resulting in a 52.4% recovery rate and 968 DALYs.  Despite high healthcare access (86.28%), a considerable number of doctors (4.73 per 1000), and a high per capita income ($64,119 USD), the relatively high prevalence and mortality rates suggest areas for improvement in disease control and treatment, especially considering the low number of hospital beds (0.73 per 1000)."
