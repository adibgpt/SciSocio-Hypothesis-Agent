        "response": "Here's an analysis of the provided data, presented as requested:\n\n\n**Angola (AGO) in 2020:**  In Angola (AGO) during 2020, carbon dioxide emissions totaled 53,400,000 metric tons,  broken down as follows: 3,020,000 from buildings, 1,050,000 from industry, a substantial 35,480,000 from land use change and forestry, 20,000 from other fuel combustion, 5,630,000 from transport, 1,330,000 from manufacturing and construction, 3,620,000 from fugitive emissions in energy production, and 5,130,000 from electricity and heat production, with an additional 1,400,000 from bunker fuels.  This data highlights the significant contribution of land use change and forestry to Angola's overall carbon emissions in 2020.\n\n\n**Antigua and Barbuda (ATG) in 1990:** In Antigua and Barbuda (ATG) during 1990, carbon dioxide emissions amounted to 400,000 metric tons, comprising 10,000 tons from buildings, 100,000 tons from transport, 110,000 tons from electricity and heat, and 190,000 tons from bunker fuels;  industry, land use change and forestry, and other fuel combustion contributed zero emissions.  The data shows that the majority of emissions in 1990 originated from transport and bunker fuels.\n\n\n**Antigua and Barbuda (ATG) in 1991:**  In Antigua and Barbuda (ATG) in 1991, carbon dioxide emissions summed to 400,000 metric tons, with 10,000 tons from buildings, 110,000 tons from transport, 100,000 tons from electricity and heat, and 190,000 tons from bunker fuels, while industry, land use change and forestry, and other fuel combustion sources registered no emissions.  The data for 1991 is nearly identical to that of 1990, suggesting a consistent emission profile during this period.\n\n\n**Antigua and Barbuda (ATG) in 1992:** In Antigua and Barbuda (ATG) during 1992, carbon dioxide emissions reached 400,000 metric tons, consisting of 10,000 tons from buildings, 110,000 tons from transport, 100,000 tons from electricity and heat, and 190,000 tons from bunker fuels; emissions from industry, land use change and forestry, and other fuel combustion were negligible. Similar to the preceding years, transport and bunker fuels were the main sources of emissions.\n\n\n**Antigua and Barbuda (ATG) in 1993:** In Antigua and Barbuda (ATG) in 1993, carbon dioxide emissions totaled 400,000 metric tons, composed of 10,000 tons from buildings, 110,000 tons from transport, 100,000 tons from electricity and heat, and 190,000 tons from bunker fuels; there were no recorded emissions from industry, land use change and forestry, or other fuel combustion. The data indicates a stable emission pattern across the years 1990-1993."
