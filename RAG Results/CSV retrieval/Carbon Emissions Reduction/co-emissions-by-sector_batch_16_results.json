        "response": "Here's an analysis of the provided data, presented as requested:\n\n\n**2003:** In 2003, Albania (ALB) recorded carbon dioxide emissions of 450,000 from buildings, 300,000 from industry, a net removal of 1,120,000 from land use change and forestry, 600,000 from other fuel combustion, 1,920,000 from transport, 500,000 from manufacturing and construction, 360,000 from electricity and heat, and 140,000 from bunker fuels.  This shows that transport was the largest source of emissions, while land use change and forestry acted as a carbon sink.\n\n\n**2004:** In 2004, Albania (ALB) had carbon dioxide emissions of 400,000 from buildings, 300,000 from industry, a net removal of 1,120,000 from land use change and forestry, 490,000 from other fuel combustion, 2,310,000 from transport, 550,000 from manufacturing and construction, 280,000 from electricity and heat, and 150,000 from bunker fuels.  Transport emissions significantly increased compared to 2003, remaining the dominant source, while land use change and forestry continued to act as a substantial carbon sink.\n\n\n**2005:** In 2005, Albania (ALB) showed carbon dioxide emissions of 370,000 from buildings, 260,000 from industry, a net removal of 1,120,000 from land use change and forestry, 340,000 from other fuel combustion, 2,380,000 from transport, 450,000 from manufacturing and construction, 300,000 from electricity and heat, and 180,000 from bunker fuels.  Again, transport emissions were highest, and land use change and forestry continued to absorb a large amount of CO2.  Industrial emissions decreased compared to previous years.\n\n\n**2006:**  In 2006, Albania (ALB) registered carbon dioxide emissions of 410,000 from buildings, 280,000 from industry, a net removal of 1,120,000 from land use change and forestry, 530,000 from other fuel combustion, 1,920,000 from transport, 680,000 from manufacturing and construction, approximately 260,000 from electricity and heat, and 140,000 from bunker fuels.  Transport remained the largest emitter, with land use change and forestry continuing to offset emissions.  Manufacturing and construction emissions increased compared to 2005.\n\n\n**2007:** In 2007, Albania (ALB) exhibited carbon dioxide emissions of 280,000 from buildings, 470,000 from industry, a net removal of 1,120,000 from land use change and forestry, 440,000 from other fuel combustion, 2,100,000 from transport, 640,000 from manufacturing and construction, 330,000 from electricity and heat, and 60,000 from bunker fuels.  Transport remained the primary source of emissions, while land use change and forestry continued its consistent carbon sink role.  Industrial emissions increased compared to the previous year."
