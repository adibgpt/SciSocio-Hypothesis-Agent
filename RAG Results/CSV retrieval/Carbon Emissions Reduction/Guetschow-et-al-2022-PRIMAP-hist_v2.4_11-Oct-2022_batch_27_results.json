        "response": "The provided data consists of multiple rows, each representing CO2 and FGASES emissions data for Angola (AGO) from 1750 to 2021, categorized by IPCC2006_PRIMAP categories.  Each row shares the same `scenario (PRIMAP-hist)` value of \"HISTCR\" and `area (ISO3)` value of \"AGO\".  However, they differ in the `entity`, `unit`, and `category (IPCC2006_PRIMAP)` columns.  A detailed description of each row type follows:\n\n\n**Row Type 1:  `entity: CO2`, `unit: CO2 * gigagram / a`, `category (IPCC2006_PRIMAP): 2.D`**\n\nThis row presents the annual CO2 emissions in gigagrams for Angola from 1750 to 2021, specifically categorized under the IPCC2006_PRIMAP category 2.D (likely representing a specific emission source).  The data shows zero emissions until 1950, after which emissions gradually increase, with some fluctuations year to year, reaching over 60 gigagrams by 2021.  This indicates a significant increase in CO2 emissions in Angola since the mid-20th century.\n\n\n**Row Type 2: `entity: FGASES (AR4GWP100)`, `unit: CO2 * gigagram / a`, `category (IPCC2006_PRIMAP): 2`**\n\nThis row details the total annual greenhouse gas emissions (FGASES) in Angola, expressed as CO2 equivalents using the AR4GWP100 global warming potential, from 1750-2021, categorized under IPCC2006_PRIMAP category 2 (a broader category than 2.D).  Emissions are negligible until the early 20th century, after which they show a slow increase with significant spikes in the late 1990s and early 2000s before continuing to increase steadily to over 65 gigagrams of CO2 equivalent by 2021.  This suggests a substantial growth in overall greenhouse gas emissions, possibly due to economic development and changes in land use.\n\n\n**Row Type 3: `entity: CO2`, `unit: CO2 * gigagram / a`, `category (IPCC2006_PRIMAP): M.0.EL`**\n\nThis row displays annual CO2 emissions in gigagrams for Angola from 1750 to 2021, specifically attributed to the energy and land use sector (M.0.EL in the IPCC2006_PRIMAP classification).  Similar to row type 1, emissions are zero until 1950, but then increase significantly, exhibiting high variability and large spikes throughout the period.  The data suggests substantial CO2 emissions from this sector, making it a key contributor to Angola's overall carbon footprint.\n\n\n**Row Type 4: `entity: FGASES (AR4GWP100)`, `unit: CO2 * gigagram / a`, `category (IPCC2006_PRIMAP): M.0.EL`**\n\nThis row shows annual greenhouse gas emissions in CO2 equivalents from the energy and land use sector (M.0.EL) in Angola from 1750-2021, using the AR4GWP100 global warming potential.  Emissions remain almost zero until 1950. Then, they increase gradually, with some years showing very large increases.  The data shows a pattern of growth in greenhouse gas emissions from this sector, similar to the CO2 emissions from the same sector, but expressed in CO2 equivalents.\n\n\nIn summary, the data provides a time series of CO2 and greenhouse gas emissions for Angola, broken down by specific emission sectors. The data shows a clear upward trend in emissions since the mid-20th century, highlighting the need for further investigation into the drivers of this increase and potential mitigation strategies."
