        "response": "Here's an analysis of the provided data, presented as requested:\n\n\n**2010:** In 2010, Angola (AGO) reported carbon dioxide emissions of 3,620,000 from buildings, 580,000 from industry, 35,500,000 from land use change and forestry, 40,000 from other fuel combustion, 5,680,000 from transport, 2,340,000 from manufacturing and construction, 7,930,000 from fugitive emissions in energy production, 2,610,000 from electricity and heat, and 1,550,000 from bunker fuels;  this reveals that land use change and forestry were the dominant source of CO2 emissions, significantly outweighing all other sectors combined.\n\n\n**2011:** In 2011, Angola (AGO) had carbon dioxide emissions of 3,990,000 from buildings, 760,000 from industry, 35,500,000 from land use change and forestry, 40,000 from other fuel combustion, 6,280,000 from transport, 2,420,000 from manufacturing and construction, 7,930,000 fugitive emissions from energy production, 2,450,000 from electricity and heat, and 1,380,000 from bunker fuels;  similar to 2010, land use change and forestry remained the largest contributor to emissions, while other sectors showed modest increases compared to the previous year.\n\n\n**2012:**  In 2012, Angola (AGO) recorded carbon dioxide emissions of 4,500,000 from buildings, 1,150,000 from industry, 35,500,000 from land use change and forestry, 50,000 from other fuel combustion, 6,740,000 from transport, 2,220,000 from manufacturing and construction, 6,280,000 fugitive emissions from energy production, 2,930,000 from electricity and heat, and 2,160,000 from bunker fuels; again, land use change and forestry dominated emissions, while other sectors showed some fluctuation in their contribution.\n\n\n**2013:** During 2013, Angola (AGO) experienced carbon dioxide emissions of 5,570,000 from buildings, 1,560,000 from industry, 35,500,000 from land use change and forestry, 60,000 from other fuel combustion, 7,700,000 from transport, 1,620,000 from manufacturing and construction, 6,120,000 fugitive emissions from energy production, 4,330,000 from electricity and heat, and 1,910,000 from bunker fuels;  similar to previous years, land use change and forestry were responsible for the vast majority of emissions, with a general upward trend observed across several sectors.\n\n\n**2014:** In 2014, Angola (AGO) emitted 5,430,000 tons of carbon dioxide from buildings, 1,980,000 from industry, 35,500,000 from land use change and forestry, 60,000 from other fuel combustion, 7,940,000 from transport, 1,460,000 from manufacturing and construction, 6,750,000 fugitive emissions from energy production, 6,000,000 from electricity and heat, and 2,490,000 from bunker fuels;  land use change and forestry remained the primary source of CO2 emissions, while emissions from other sectors, such as buildings, transport, and electricity and heat, showed increases compared to previous years."
