        "response": "Here's an analysis of the provided data, presented as requested:\n\n\n**Row 1 (Year 2003):**  In Angola (AGO) during 2003, carbon dioxide emissions totaled 56,212,000,  comprising 1,250,000 from buildings, 280,000 from industry, a substantial 35,510,000 from land use change and forestry, 10,000 from other fuel combustion, 2,750,000 from transport, 1,830,000 from manufacturing and construction, 9,420,000 from fugitive emissions in energy production, 1,220,000 from electricity and heat, and 800,000 from bunker fuels.  Land use change and forestry were the dominant source of emissions in Angola during this year.\n\n**Row 2 (Year 2001):** In Angola (AGO) in 2001, total CO2 emissions reached 50,120,000, with 1,170,000 from buildings, 220,000 from industry, 35,510,000 from land use change and forestry, 0 from other fuel combustion, 1,200,000 from transport, 1,620,000 from manufacturing and construction, 10,700,000 from fugitive emissions in energy production, 1,039,999.94 from electricity and heat, and 1,550,000 from bunker fuels.  Similar to 2003, land use change and forestry dominated emissions, while fugitive emissions from energy production were significantly higher than other sectors.\n\n**Row 3 (Year 2002):** Angola (AGO) experienced 49,842,000 tons of CO2 emissions in 2002, consisting of 1,190,000 from buildings, 240,000 from industry, 35,510,000 from land use change and forestry, 10,000 from other fuel combustion, 1,480,000 from transport, 1,780,000 from manufacturing and construction, 9,950,000 from fugitive emissions in energy production, 1,050,000 from electricity and heat, and 1,330,000 from bunker fuels.  Again, land use change and forestry represented the largest source of emissions.\n\n**Row 4 (Year 2004):** In Angola (AGO) during 2004, CO2 emissions amounted to 55,822,000, broken down as follows: 1,290,000 from buildings, 300,000 from industry, 35,510,000 from land use change and forestry, 20,000 from other fuel combustion, 3,450,000 from transport, 2,100,000 from manufacturing and construction, 9,440,000 from fugitive emissions in energy production, 860,000 from electricity and heat, and 1,300,000 from bunker fuels.  Land use change and forestry remained the primary contributor to emissions.\n\n**Row 5 (Year 2000):** In Angola (AGO) in 2000, total CO2 emissions were 24,740,000, with 1,050,000 from buildings, 80,000 from industry, 10,190,000 from land use change and forestry, 0 from other fuel combustion, 1,070,000 from transport, 1,570,000 from manufacturing and construction, 11,490,000 from fugitive emissions in energy production, 940,000 from electricity and heat, and 1,430,000 from bunker fuels.  While land use change and forestry still contributed significantly, fugitive emissions from energy production were notably higher in 2000 compared to later years.\n\n\n**Overall Summary:**  Across all years, land use change and forestry consistently represent the dominant source of CO2 emissions in Angola.  Fugitive emissions from energy production also constitute a substantial portion of total emissions.  Other sectors, such as transport, buildings, and industry, contribute significantly less compared to these two major sources.  There's also noticeable year-to-year variation in emissions from several sectors, suggesting potential fluctuations in economic activity and environmental practices."
