        "response": "Here's an analysis of the provided data, presented as requested:\n\n\n**2014:** In 2014, Afghanistan (AFG) recorded carbon dioxide emissions of 1,730,000 from buildings, 30,000 from industry, a net removal of 250,000 from land use change and forestry, 120,000 from other fuel combustion, 3,530,000 from transport, and 3,710,000 from manufacturing and construction, along with 170,000 from electricity and heat and 180,000 from bunker fuels.  This shows that transport and manufacturing/construction were the largest contributors to CO2 emissions in Afghanistan during this year.\n\n\n**2011:**  In 2011, Afghanistan (AFG) had carbon dioxide emissions of 820,000 from buildings, 10,000 from industry, a net removal of 250,000 from land use change and forestry, 60,000 from other fuel combustion, 6,710,000 from transport, and 4,170,000 from manufacturing and construction, in addition to 190,000 from electricity and heat and 980,000 from bunker fuels.  Compared to 2014, transport emissions were significantly higher in 2011 while building emissions were lower.\n\n\n**2013:**  In 2013, Afghanistan (AFG) showed carbon dioxide emissions of 1,340,000 from buildings, 40,000 from industry, a net removal of 250,000 from land use change and forestry, 110,000 from other fuel combustion, 4,330,000 from transport, and 220,000 from electricity and heat, and 190,000 from bunker fuels.  Manufacturing and construction emissions are missing for this year, hindering a complete comparison.\n\n\n**2012:**  Afghanistan (AFG) in 2012 registered carbon dioxide emissions of 840,000 from buildings, 30,000 from industry, a net removal of 250,000 from land use change and forestry, 100,000 from other fuel combustion, 5,850,000 from transport, and 3,250,000 from manufacturing and construction,  plus 150,000 from electricity and heat and 280,000 from bunker fuels.  Transport remains a dominant source of emissions, consistently higher than other sectors.\n\n\n**2010:** In 2010, Afghanistan (AFG) experienced carbon dioxide emissions of 500,000 from buildings, 10,000 from industry, a net addition of 120,000 from land use change and forestry (unlike other years), 0 from other fuel combustion, 5,540,000 from transport, and 2,390,000 from manufacturing and construction, with 140,000 from electricity and heat and 350,000 from bunker fuels.  This year is notable for the positive contribution from land use change and forestry, contrasting with the negative values in other years.  Transport was again the largest source of emissions.\n\n\nNote:  Fugitive emissions from energy production are missing for all years, making a complete analysis impossible.  There are also inconsistencies in data availability across the years."
