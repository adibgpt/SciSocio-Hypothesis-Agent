        "response": "Here's an analysis of the provided data, presented as requested:\n\n\n**1995:** In Afghanistan (AFG) during 1995, carbon dioxide emissions from buildings totaled 160,000, industry contributed 50,000, land use change and forestry resulted in a net removal of 2,390,000, other fuel combustion was 0, transport emitted 730,000, manufacturing and construction added 340,000, electricity and heat production released 180,000, and bunker fuels contributed 20,000.  This reveals that despite significant carbon sequestration from land use change and forestry, transportation and manufacturing/construction were major contributors to overall emissions.\n\n**1996:**  In Afghanistan (AFG) during 1996, carbon dioxide emissions stemmed from buildings (170,000), industry (50,000), a net removal from land use change and forestry (-2,390,000), zero emissions from other fuel combustion, transport (700,000), manufacturing and construction (320,000), electricity and heat (170,000), and bunker fuels (20,000).  Similar to 1995, land use change and forestry acted as a significant carbon sink, while transport and manufacturing/construction remained substantial emission sources.\n\n**1997:**  Afghanistan (AFG) in 1997 saw carbon dioxide emissions originating from buildings (170,000), industry (50,000), a net removal due to land use change and forestry (-2,390,000), no emissions from other fuel combustion, transport (670,000), manufacturing and construction (300,000), electricity and heat (160,000), and bunker fuels (20,000).  The data again highlights the substantial carbon sequestration from land use change and forestry, while transport and manufacturing/construction remained significant emission sources, showing a slight decrease in transport emissions compared to 1996.\n\n**1998:** In Afghanistan (AFG) during 1998, the sources of carbon dioxide emissions included buildings (170,000), industry (50,000), a net removal from land use change and forestry (-2,390,000), no emissions from other fuel combustion, transport (670,000), manufacturing and construction (280,000), electricity and heat (160,000), and bunker fuels (20,000).  The pattern of high emissions from transport and manufacturing/construction continues, offset to some degree by the large carbon sink from land use change and forestry; transport emissions remained consistent with 1997.\n\n**1999:**  In Afghanistan (AFG) in 1999, carbon dioxide emissions were generated by buildings (170,000), industry (50,000), land use change and forestry resulted in a net removal of 2,390,000, other fuel combustion contributed 0, transport emitted 490,000, manufacturing and construction added 250,000, electricity and heat production released 160,000, and bunker fuels contributed 20,000.  This year shows a notable decrease in transport and manufacturing/construction emissions compared to previous years, further emphasizing the fluctuating nature of these emission sources within this period.\n\n\n**Summary:** The data consistently shows a massive net removal of CO2 due to land use change and forestry in Afghanistan throughout the period 1995-1999.  However,  transport and manufacturing/construction are significant emission sources, with some fluctuation in their contribution from year to year.  Industry emissions remain relatively constant. The lack of data for fugitive emissions from energy production limits a complete analysis."
