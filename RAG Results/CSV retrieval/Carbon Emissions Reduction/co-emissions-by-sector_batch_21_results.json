        "response": "Here's an analysis of the provided data, following the requested format.  Note that the data is presented as text, not a CSV file, so the analysis is based on that text format.\n\n\n**Year 1997:** In 1997, Algeria (DZA) reported carbon dioxide emissions of 7,980,000 from buildings, 3,270,000 from industry, 570,000 from land use change and forestry, 0 from other fuel combustion, 15,010,000 from transport, 5,290,000 from manufacturing and construction, 15,170,000 as fugitive emissions from energy production, 27,710,000 from electricity and heat, and 1,890,000 from bunker fuels.  This shows that transportation and electricity/heat production were the largest contributors to CO2 emissions in Algeria during that year.\n\n**Year 1998:**  In 1998, Algeria (DZA) had CO2 emissions of 8,630,000 from buildings, 3,450,000 from industry, 570,000 from land use change and forestry, 0 from other fuel combustion, 15,460,000 from transport, 5,660,000 from manufacturing and construction, 13,680,000 in fugitive emissions from energy production, 27,770,000 from electricity and heat, and 1,770,000 from bunker fuels.  Compared to 1997, there was a slight increase across most emission categories, indicating a modest growth in overall emissions.\n\n**Year 1999:** In 1999, Algeria (DZA) recorded 9,090,000 in CO2 emissions from buildings, 3,440,000 from industry, 570,000 from land use change and forestry, 0 from other fuel combustion, 16,469,999 from transport, 6,050,000 from manufacturing and construction, 13,150,000 in fugitive emissions from energy production, 29,310,000 from electricity and heat, and 1,780,000 from bunker fuels.  Transport and electricity/heat continued to be major sources, with transport showing a notable increase compared to the previous year.\n\n**Year 2000:** During 2000, Algeria (DZA) emitted 9,330,000 tons of CO2 from buildings, 3,790,000 from industry, 570,000 from land use change and forestry, 0 from other fuel combustion, 16,850,000 from transport, 6,160,000 from manufacturing and construction, 14,750,000 in fugitive emissions from energy production, 29,170,000 from electricity and heat, and 1,960,000 from bunker fuels.  Emissions continued their upward trend from previous years, although the increase was less pronounced than in some previous years.\n\n**Year 2001:** In 2001, Algeria (DZA) showed CO2 emissions of 9,530,000 from buildings, 3,770,000 from industry, -2,410,000 from land use change and forestry (indicating a net absorption), 0 from other fuel combustion, 17,040,000 from transport, 6,250,000 from manufacturing and construction, 11,860,000 in fugitive emissions from energy production, 30,200,000 from electricity and heat, and 1,980,000 from bunker fuels.  The negative value for land use change and forestry suggests a carbon sink effect, partially offsetting other emissions; however, overall emissions continued to rise."
