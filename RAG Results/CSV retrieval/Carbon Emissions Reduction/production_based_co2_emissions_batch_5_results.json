        "response": "Here's an analysis of the provided data, following the requested format. Note that some years are missing data for Bosnia and Herzegovina.\n\n**Bulgaria (BGR):**  The country Bulgaria (ISO3: BGR), located in Europe within the Northern Hemisphere, exhibited a per capita CO2e emission of 11.24 metric tons in 1990, which decreased to 8.28 metric tons by 1995, further declining to a low of 7.16 metric tons in 2000 before slightly increasing to around 7.5-8 metric tons per capita in subsequent years.  This suggests an initial sharp decrease in emissions followed by a period of relative stability.\n\n**Brunei (BRN):** Brunei (ISO3: BRN), an Asian nation in the Northern Hemisphere, consistently showed high per capita CO2e emissions, ranging from approximately 46 to 48 metric tons between 1990 and 2013, with a notable decrease to 38.75 metric tons in 2018.  This indicates a generally high carbon footprint, followed by a significant drop in recent years.\n\n**Brazil (BRA):** Brazil (ISO3: BRA), situated in the Southern Hemisphere of the Americas, experienced a gradual increase in per capita CO2e emissions from 3.73 metric tons in 1990 to a peak of 5.03 metric tons in 2013, before slightly decreasing to 4.93 metric tons in 2018. This shows a slow but consistent upward trend in emissions, followed by a minor recent decline.\n\n**Botswana (BWA):** Botswana (ISO3: BWA), an African country in the Southern Hemisphere, demonstrated fluctuating per capita CO2e emissions, ranging from a high of approximately 9 metric tons in the early 1990s to a low of 5.58 metric tons in 2005, before increasing again to 7.15 metric tons in 2018. This reveals a less consistent pattern, with periods of both decrease and increase in emissions.\n\n**Bosnia and Herzegovina (BIH):** Bosnia and Herzegovina (ISO3: BIH), a European country in the Northern Hemisphere, had missing data for 1990, but shows a substantial increase in per capita CO2e emissions from 1.81 metric tons in 1995 to 8.18 metric tons in 2018. This represents a dramatic rise in emissions over the period for which data is available."
