        "response": "Here's an analysis of the provided data, following the requested format:\n\n\n**Row 1 (KNA - Saint Kitts and Nevis):**  ISO3 code KNA represents Saint Kitts and Nevis, a country located in America within the Northern Hemisphere.  From 1990 to 2018, its metric tons of CO2e per capita increased from 4.77 to a peak of 8.04 in 2013 before slightly decreasing to 7.03 in 2018, indicating a general upward trend in per capita emissions with a recent slight decline.\n\n**Row 2 (RWA - Rwanda):**  The ISO3 code RWA corresponds to Rwanda, an African nation situated in the Southern Hemisphere.  Rwanda's metric tons of CO2e per capita remained relatively stable and low between 1990 and 2018, fluctuating between 0.5 and 0.63, suggesting consistently low per capita greenhouse gas emissions.\n\n**Row 3 (WSM - Samoa):**  Samoa (ISO3: WSM), an Oceanian country in the Southern Hemisphere, showed a gradual increase in metric tons of CO2e per capita from 2.17 in 1990 to 3.52 in 2018, indicating a steady growth in per capita emissions over the period.\n\n**Row 4 (LCA - Saint Lucia):**  Saint Lucia (ISO3: LCA), located in America in the Northern Hemisphere, experienced a relatively stable level of CO2e emissions per capita between 1990 and 2010, fluctuating around 6.5, before a significant drop to 4.05 in 2018. This suggests a recent and substantial decrease in per capita emissions.\n\n**Row 5 (VCT - Saint Vincent and the Grenadines):**  Saint Vincent and the Grenadines (ISO3: VCT), an American country in the Northern Hemisphere, demonstrated a steady increase in metric tons of CO2e per capita from 1.41 in 1990 to 3.32 in 2018, showing a consistent, albeit moderate, growth in per capita emissions."
