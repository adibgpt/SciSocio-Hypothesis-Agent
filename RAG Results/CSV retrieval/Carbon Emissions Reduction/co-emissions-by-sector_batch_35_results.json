        "response": "Here's an analysis of the provided data, presented as requested:\n\n**Row 1 (Year 2005):**  In Angola (AGO) during 2005, carbon dioxide emissions totaled 57,600,000 tonnes,  broken down as follows: 970,000 tonnes from buildings, 520,000 tonnes from industry, 35,510,000 tonnes from land use change and forestry, 10,000 tonnes from other fuel combustion, 2,480,000 tonnes from transport, 1,720,000 tonnes from manufacturing and construction, 9,140,000 tonnes from fugitive emissions in energy production, 980,000 tonnes from electricity and heat, and 910,000 tonnes from bunker fuels.  Land use change and forestry overwhelmingly dominated emissions in 2005.\n\n**Row 2 (Year 2009):** In Angola (AGO) in 2009,  a total of 57,600,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide were emitted; this included 3,430,000 tonnes from buildings, 690,000 tonnes from industry, 35,500,000 tonnes from land use change and forestry, 40,000 tonnes from other fuel combustion, 5,760,000 tonnes from transport, 2,180,000 tonnes from manufacturing and construction, 6,580,000 tonnes from fugitive emissions in energy production, 2,460,000 tonnes from electricity and heat, and 1,190,000 tonnes from bunker fuels.  Similar to 2005, land use change and forestry remained the largest source of emissions, although emissions from buildings and transport also significantly increased.\n\n**Row 3 (Year 2006):**  Angola (AGO)'s carbon dioxide emissions in 2006 amounted to 52,000,000 tonnes, comprising 1,920,000 tonnes from buildings, 540,000 tonnes from industry, 35,510,000 tonnes from land use change and forestry, 20,000 tonnes from other fuel combustion, 3,290,000 tonnes from transport, 1,960,000 tonnes from manufacturing and construction, 7,770,000 tonnes from fugitive emissions in energy production, 1,070,000 tonnes from electricity and heat, and 810,000 tonnes from bunker fuels. Again, land use change and forestry was the primary source of emissions.\n\n**Row 4 (Year 2007):** In Angola (AGO) during 2007, 51,500,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide were emitted, with the following breakdown: 2,280,000 tonnes from buildings, 540,000 tonnes from industry, 35,510,000 tonnes from land use change and forestry, 30,000 tonnes from other fuel combustion, 3,900,000 tonnes from transport, 2,270,000 tonnes from manufacturing and construction, 6,770,000 tonnes from fugitive emissions in energy production, 1,180,000 tonnes from electricity and heat, and 1,220,000 tonnes from bunker fuels.  Land use change and forestry continued to be the dominant contributor to emissions.\n\n**Row 5 (Year 2008):** Angola (AGO)'s carbon dioxide emissions in 2008 reached approximately 52,000,000 tonnes, consisting of 2,900,000 tonnes from buildings, 680,000 tonnes from industry, 35,500,000 tonnes from land use change and forestry, 30,000 tonnes from other fuel combustion, 5,200,000 tonnes from transport, 2,090,000 tonnes from manufacturing and construction, 6,770,000 tonnes from fugitive emissions in energy production, 1,590,000 tonnes from electricity and heat, and 1,310,000 tonnes from bunker fuels.  Once again, land use change and forestry was the most significant source of emissions.\n\n\n**Overall Summary:** Across all years (2005-2009), Angola's CO2 emissions remained relatively stable, with land use change and forestry consistently accounting for the vast majority (over 60%) of total emissions.  While emissions from other sectors (buildings, transport, industry) showed some increases over the period, their contribution remained comparatively small compared to the impact of land use change and forestry."
