        "response": "Here's an analysis of the provided data, following the requested format:\n\n**Row 1 (Year: 1999):**  In 1999, Antigua and Barbuda (ATG) reported carbon dioxide emissions of 10,000 from buildings, 140,000 from transport, 150,000 from electricity and heat, and 210,000 from bunker fuels, with zero emissions from industry, land use change and forestry, other fuel combustion, and manufacturing and construction.  This shows that transport, electricity and heat, and bunker fuels were the dominant sources of CO2 emissions in Antigua and Barbuda in 1999, while other sectors contributed minimally.\n\n**Row 2 (Year: 2000):** In 2000, Antigua and Barbuda (ATG) had 10,000 tons of CO2 emissions from buildings, 150,000 from transport, 160,000 from electricity and heat, and 210,000 from bunker fuels, with all other emission categories recording zero.  Similar to 1999, the majority of emissions stemmed from transport, electricity and heat, and bunker fuels, indicating a consistent emission pattern across these sectors.\n\n**Row 3 (Year: 2001):**  Antigua and Barbuda (ATG) in 2001 showed 10,000 tons of CO2 emissions from buildings, 150,000 from transport, 170,000 from electricity and heat, and 210,000 from bunker fuels; other sectors reported zero emissions.  This shows a slight increase in electricity and heat emissions compared to 2000, while transport and bunker fuel emissions remained stable.\n\n**Row 4 (Year: 2002):** In 2002, Antigua and Barbuda (ATG) recorded 10,000 tons of CO2 emissions from buildings, 150,000 from transport, 180,000 from electricity and heat, and 210,000 from bunker fuels; all other sectors reported zero emissions.  A continued, gradual increase in electricity and heat emissions is observed, suggesting potential growth in energy consumption.\n\n**Row 5 (Year: 2003):**  Antigua and Barbuda (ATG) in 2003 exhibited 10,000 tons of CO2 emissions from buildings, 160,000 from transport, 190,000 from electricity and heat, and 210,000 from bunker fuels, with zero emissions from all other sectors.  This year shows increases in both transport and electricity and heat emissions compared to the previous year, indicating potential economic growth and increased energy demand.\n\n\n**Summary:**  Across all five years (1999-2003), Antigua and Barbuda's CO2 emissions were consistently dominated by transport, electricity and heat, and bunker fuels, with minimal contributions from other sectors.  There is a clear upward trend in emissions from electricity and heat, and a slight increase in transport emissions over the period, suggesting a growth in energy consumption and economic activity.  The consistently high bunker fuel emissions suggest a significant reliance on maritime transport.  The lack of data on fugitive emissions from energy production limits a complete understanding of the overall emissions profile."
