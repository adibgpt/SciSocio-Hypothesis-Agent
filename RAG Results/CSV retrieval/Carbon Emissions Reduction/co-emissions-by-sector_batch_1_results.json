        "response": "Here's an analysis of the provided data, following the requested format:\n\n\n**1990:** In 1990, Afghanistan (AFG) had carbon dioxide emissions from buildings at 129,999.99, industry at 50,000, land use change and forestry at -2,390,000, transport at 980,000, manufacturing and construction at 570,000, electricity and heat at 320,000, and bunker fuels at 20,000; other fuel combustion emissions were 0.  This indicates a net carbon sink due to land use change and forestry, despite significant emissions from transport and other sectors.\n\n**1991:**  In 1991, Afghanistan (AFG) showed carbon dioxide emissions from buildings of 140,000, industry at 50,000, land use change and forestry at -2,390,000, transport at 930,000, manufacturing and construction at 530,000, electricity and heat at 300,000, and bunker fuels at 20,000, with no emissions from other fuel combustion.  Similar to 1990, a substantial carbon sink is evident from land use change and forestry, alongside a decrease in transport emissions compared to the previous year.\n\n**1992:** During 1992, Afghanistan (AFG) recorded carbon dioxide emissions from buildings of 150,000, industry at 50,000, land use change and forestry at -2,390,000, transport at 740,000, manufacturing and construction at 390,000, electricity and heat at 200,000, and bunker fuels at 20,000;  other fuel combustion emissions remained at 0. This year shows a notable decrease in transport and manufacturing/construction emissions compared to 1991, while maintaining a large carbon sink from land use change and forestry.\n\n**1993:** In 1993, Afghanistan (AFG) had carbon dioxide emissions from buildings at 160,000, industry at 50,000, land use change and forestry at -2,390,000, transport at 740,000, manufacturing and construction at 380,000, electricity and heat at 200,000, and bunker fuels at 20,000, with no emissions from other fuel combustion.  The pattern of a large carbon sink from land use and forestry continues, alongside relatively stable emissions from other sectors compared to the previous year.\n\n**1994:**  In 1994, Afghanistan (AFG) registered carbon dioxide emissions from buildings of 160,000, industry at 50,000, land use change and forestry at -2,390,000, transport at 730,000, manufacturing and construction at 360,000, electricity and heat at 190,000, and bunker fuels at 20,000, with no emissions from other fuel combustion.  This year shows a slight decrease in transport and manufacturing/construction emissions compared to 1993, while the substantial carbon sink from land use change and forestry persists.\n\n\n**Summary:** The data reveals a consistent large negative value for carbon dioxide emissions from land use change and forestry in Afghanistan throughout the period 1990-1994, suggesting a significant carbon sink.  Emissions from other sectors, such as buildings, transport, and manufacturing/construction, show some fluctuation but generally remain relatively stable over the five years.  Industry emissions remain consistently low at 50,000.  The lack of data for fugitive emissions from energy production limits a complete analysis."
