        "response": "Here's an analysis of the provided data, following the requested format:\n\n**Row 1:**  The Anzsic code ZGZ, representing goods-producing industries, reported 5641 kilotonnes of seasonally adjusted carbon dioxide equivalent gas emissions in 2015Q1, marked with a status of 'P'. This suggests a relatively high level of emissions from the goods-producing sector during the first quarter of 2015.\n\n**Row 2:** The Anzsic code ZGZ, representing goods-producing industries, showed 5080 kilotonnes of seasonally adjusted carbon dioxide equivalent gas emissions in 2014Q1, with a status of 'P'.  This indicates a lower level of emissions compared to 2015Q1, suggesting potential fluctuations in emissions within the goods-producing sector.\n\n**Row 3:** For Anzsic code ZGZ (goods-producing industries), seasonally adjusted carbon dioxide equivalent gas emissions were 5427 kilotonnes in 2014Q2, with a status of 'P'.  This represents a notable increase compared to 2014Q1, indicating possible seasonal variations in emissions within the goods-producing sector.\n\n**Row 4:**  Anzsic code ZGZ (goods-producing industries) recorded 5644 kilotonnes of seasonally adjusted carbon dioxide equivalent gas emissions in 2014Q4,  with a status of 'P'.  This figure is very close to the emissions reported for 2015Q1, suggesting potential year-end increases in emissions from this sector.\n\n**Row 5:**  In 2014Q3, Anzsic code ZGZ (goods-producing industries) emitted 5452 kilotonnes of seasonally adjusted carbon dioxide equivalent gas, marked with a status of 'P'. This value falls between the emissions reported for 2014Q2 and 2014Q4, showing some level of fluctuation throughout the year within the goods-producing sector."
