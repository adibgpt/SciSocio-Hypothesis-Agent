        "response": "Here's an analysis of the provided data, presented as requested.  Note that the data is presented as text, not a CSV file,  so the formatting is adapted accordingly.\n\n\n**2011:** In 2011, Algeria (DZA) had carbon dioxide emissions totaling 146,100,000 from buildings, 81,899,999.5 from industry, a net removal of 630,000 from land use change and forestry, 3,960,000 from other fuel combustion, 34,220,000 from transport, 10,800,000 from manufacturing and construction, 9,700,000 in fugitive emissions from energy production, 39,300,000 from electricity and heat, and 2,250,000 from bunker fuels.  This indicates that the largest contributors to CO2 emissions were electricity and heat production and transport.\n\n**2010:** In 2010, Algeria (DZA) recorded carbon dioxide emissions of 13,240,000 from buildings, 8,250,000 from industry, a net removal of 2,410,000 from land use change and forestry, 3,570,000 from other fuel combustion, 31,710,000 from transport, 10,690,000 from manufacturing and construction, 10,290,000 in fugitive emissions from energy production, 36,440,000 from electricity and heat, and 2,450,000 from bunker fuels.  Compared to 2011, emissions from transport and electricity and heat production slightly decreased, while other sectors showed minor variations.\n\n**2009:**  In 2009, Algeria (DZA) had carbon dioxide emissions of 13,480,000 from buildings, 8,220,000.5 from industry, a net removal of 2,410,000 from land use change and forestry, 3,930,000 from other fuel combustion, 30,520,000 from transport, 9,850,000 from manufacturing and construction, 9,510,000 in fugitive emissions from energy production, 36,670,000 from electricity and heat, and 2,360,000 from bunker fuels.  Emissions from electricity and heat remained high, while transport emissions show a continued downward trend from 2010.\n\n**2007:** In 2007, Algeria (DZA) experienced carbon dioxide emissions of 13,600,000 from buildings, 7,000,000 from industry, a net removal of 2,410,000 from land use change and forestry, 0 from other fuel combustion, 27,600,000 from transport, 9,720,000 from manufacturing and construction, 10,870,000 in fugitive emissions from energy production, 33,960,000 from electricity and heat, and 2,230,000 from bunker fuels.  Zero emissions from other fuel combustion are notable, suggesting a change in energy sources or data collection.\n\n**2008:** In 2008, Algeria (DZA) recorded carbon dioxide emissions of 13,570,000 from buildings, 7,580,000 from industry, a net removal of 2,410,000 from land use change and forestry, 0 from other fuel combustion, 29,190,000 from transport, 10,080,000 from manufacturing and construction, 12,030,000 in fugitive emissions from energy production, 35,280,000 from electricity and heat, and 2,280,000 from bunker fuels.  Similar to 2007, there were zero emissions from other fuel combustion; however, fugitive emissions from energy production increased significantly.\n\n\nOverall, the data shows that electricity and heat production, and transport consistently represent the largest sources of CO2 emissions in Algeria during this period.  Land use change and forestry consistently resulted in a net removal of CO2.  Further analysis would require understanding the underlying methodologies and potential changes in reporting practices to draw more definitive conclusions about emission trends."
