Present the features in the row in a seamless sentence structure, describing the relationship or context between them.\n                3.

        "response": "The provided data consists of four CSV files, each representing nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions in Angola (AGO) from 1750 to 2021, categorized according to the IPCC2006_PRIMAP classification.  Each file shows N2O emissions in gigagrams per year.  The files differ in their level of N2O emission categorization:  one file shows total N2O emissions (category 1), while the others break down emissions into subcategories: 1.A, 1.B, and 1.B.2.  A detailed sentence-by-sentence analysis would be extremely lengthy given the amount of data.  However, a summary observation is that N2O emissions in Angola have significantly increased from near zero in the 1700s to over 1 gigagram per year by 2021, with variations in the rate of increase over time, and with different subcategories showing different emission trends.  Specific numerical details for each year and category would require a more extensive analysis beyond the scope of a brief response."
