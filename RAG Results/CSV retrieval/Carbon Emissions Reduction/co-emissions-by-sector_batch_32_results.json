        "response": "Here's an analysis of the provided data, presented as requested:\n\n\n**1990:** In 1990, Angola (AGO) reported carbon dioxide emissions of 630,000 from buildings, 110,000 from industry, 10,190,000 from land use change and forestry, 30,000 from other fuel combustion, 1,020,000 from transport, 1,770,000 from manufacturing and construction, 2,540,000 from fugitive emissions in energy production, 480,000 from electricity and heat, and 1,060,000 from bunker fuels;  this reveals that land use change and forestry were the dominant source of CO2 emissions, significantly outweighing all other sectors combined.\n\n**1991:** In 1991, Angola (AGO) recorded carbon dioxide emissions of 670,000 from buildings, 110,000 from industry, 10,190,000 from land use change and forestry, 20,000 from other fuel combustion, 1,260,000 from transport, 1,630,000 from manufacturing and construction, 2,550,000 from fugitive emissions in energy production, 440,000 from electricity and heat, and 910,000 from bunker fuels;  similar to 1990, land use change and forestry remained the overwhelmingly largest contributor to total emissions, while other sectors showed relatively minor changes.\n\n**1992:**  In 1992, Angola (AGO) showed carbon dioxide emissions of 610,000 from buildings, 120,000 from industry, 10,190,000 from land use change and forestry, 10,000 from other fuel combustion, 1,190,000 from transport, 1,710,000 from manufacturing and construction, 2,860,000 from fugitive emissions in energy production, 370,000 from electricity and heat, and 830,000 from bunker fuels; again, land use change and forestry dominated emissions, with a slight increase in fugitive emissions from energy production compared to 1991.\n\n**1993:** During 1993, Angola (AGO) had carbon dioxide emissions totaling 510,000 from buildings, 100,000 from industry, 10,190,000 from land use change and forestry, 10,000 from other fuel combustion, 1,210,000 from transport, 2,190,000 from manufacturing and construction, 4,940,000 from fugitive emissions in energy production, 310,000 from electricity and heat, and 940,000 from bunker fuels;  a notable increase in fugitive emissions from energy production is observed, while manufacturing and construction emissions also rose considerably, although land use change and forestry remained the most significant contributor.\n\n\n**1994:** In 1994, Angola (AGO) emitted 620,000 tons of carbon dioxide from buildings, 100,000 from industry, 10,190,000 from land use change and forestry, 10,000 from other fuel combustion, 1,540,000 from transport, 1,630,000 from manufacturing and construction, 7,020,000 from fugitive emissions in energy production, 380,000 from electricity and heat, and 1,340,000 from bunker fuels;  a substantial increase in fugitive emissions from energy production is evident compared to previous years,  further highlighting its growing importance as a source of CO2 emissions, while land use change and forestry continue to be the largest source."
