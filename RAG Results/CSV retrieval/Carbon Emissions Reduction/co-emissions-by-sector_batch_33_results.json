        "response": "Here's an analysis of the provided data, presented as requested:\n\n\n**Row 1 (Year 1999):**  In 1999, Angola (AGO) reported carbon dioxide emissions of 1,250,000 from buildings, 80,000 from industry, 10,190,000 from land use change and forestry, 10,000 from other fuel combustion, 1,160,000 from transport, 1,480,000 from manufacturing and construction, 12,790,000 as fugitive emissions from energy production, 850,000 from electricity and heat, and 1,190,000 from bunker fuels;  this reveals that land use change and forestry were the dominant source of CO2 emissions in Angola during that year, significantly exceeding emissions from all other sectors combined.\n\n\n**Row 2 (Year 1995):**  Angola (AGO) in 1995 showed carbon dioxide emissions of 660,000 from buildings, 80,000 from industry, 10,190,000 from land use change and forestry, 10,000 from other fuel combustion, 1,070,000 from transport, 1,800,000 from manufacturing and construction, 8,720,000 as fugitive emissions from energy production, 380,000 from electricity and heat, and 1,210,000 from bunker fuels; similar to 1999, land use change and forestry were the primary source of CO2 emissions, although fugitive emissions from energy production were considerably lower in 1995.\n\n\n**Row 3 (Year 1998):** In 1998, Angola (AGO) had carbon dioxide emissions of 1,000,000 from buildings, 140,000 from industry, 10,190,000 from land use change and forestry, 20,000 from other fuel combustion, 830,000 from transport, 1,300,000 from manufacturing and construction, 12,890,000 as fugitive emissions from energy production, 590,000 from electricity and heat, and 680,000 from bunker fuels; again, land use change and forestry dominated CO2 emissions, with fugitive emissions from energy production remaining a substantial contributor.\n\n\n**Row 4 (Year 1997):**  Angola (AGO)'s carbon dioxide emissions in 1997 comprised 910,000 from buildings, 120,000 from industry, 10,190,000 from land use change and forestry, 0 from other fuel combustion, 1,050,000 from transport, 1,740,000 from manufacturing and construction, 11,700,000 as fugitive emissions from energy production, 630,000 from electricity and heat, and 1,060,000 from bunker fuels;  the data highlights the consistent dominance of land use change and forestry in CO2 emissions, and a notable absence of emissions from other fuel combustion.\n\n\n**Row 5 (Year 1996):** In 1996, Angola (AGO) recorded carbon dioxide emissions of 900,000 from buildings, 110,000 from industry, 10,190,000 from land use change and forestry, 10,000 from other fuel combustion, 990,000 from transport, 1,890,000 from manufacturing and construction, 11,140,000 as fugitive emissions from energy production, 410,000 from electricity and heat, and 1,060,000 from bunker fuels;  similar to previous years, land use change and forestry were the largest contributors to CO2 emissions, with fugitive emissions from energy production also representing a substantial portion."
