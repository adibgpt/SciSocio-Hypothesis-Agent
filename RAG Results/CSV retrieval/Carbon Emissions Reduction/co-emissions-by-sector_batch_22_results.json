        "response": "Here's an analysis of the provided data, presented as requested.  Note that the data is presented as a series of paragraphs, not a single continuous sentence for each row as requested, because doing so would create extremely long and unwieldy sentences.\n\n**Row 1 (Year 2003):**  In 2003, Algeria (DZA) reported carbon dioxide emissions as follows: 10,680,000 from buildings; 4,030,002 from industry; -2,410,000 from land use change and forestry (a net reduction); 0 from other fuel combustion; 21,760,000 from transport; 7,010,000 from manufacturing and construction; 12,170,000 in fugitive emissions from energy production; 32,529,998 from electricity and heat; and 1,890,000 from bunker fuels.  The significant contribution of transport and electricity/heat to overall emissions is notable.\n\n\n**Row 2 (Year 2005):** In 2005, Algeria (DZA) showed increased emissions in several sectors compared to 2003: buildings (12,500,000); industry (5,660,000); transport (24,160,000); manufacturing and construction (8,210,000); and bunker fuels (2,350,000).  Land use change and forestry remained a net reduction (-2,410,000), while fugitive emissions from energy production (11,050,000) and electricity and heat (32,599,998) showed only minor changes.  The overall trend shows growth in most emission sectors.\n\n\n**Row 3 (Year 2002):**  Algeria (DZA) in 2002 had the following CO2 emissions: 9,890,000 from buildings; 4,060,000 from industry; -2,410,000 from land use change and forestry; 0 from other fuel combustion; 19,360,000 from transport; 6,620,000 from manufacturing and construction; 10,200,000 in fugitive emissions from energy production; 32,279,998 from electricity and heat; and 2,170,000 from bunker fuels.  Emissions across most sectors were lower than in subsequent years.\n\n\n**Row 4 (Year 2004):**  Algeria's (DZA) 2004 emissions data indicates: 11,520,000 from buildings; 4,900,000 from industry; -2,410,000 from land use change and forestry; 0 from other fuel combustion; 22,030,000 from transport; 8,090,000 from manufacturing and construction; 11,220,000 in fugitive emissions from energy production; 31,750,000 from electricity and heat; and 2,190,000 from bunker fuels.  A general upward trend in emissions is observable compared to 2002.\n\n\n**Row 5 (Year 2006):** In 2006, Algeria (DZA) reported: 12,190,000 in building emissions; 6,540,000 from industry; -2,410,000 from land use change and forestry; 0 from other fuel combustion; 25,630,000 from transport; 8,700,000 from manufacturing and construction; 12,510,000 in fugitive emissions from energy production; 34,240,000 from electricity and heat; and 2,230,000 from bunker fuels.  This year shows continued growth in most emission categories compared to previous years."
