For each row:\n\n                1. Identify and list the column names and their corresponding values.\n                2. Present the features in the row in a seamless sentence structure, describing the relationship or context between them.\n                3. Provide a summary statement based on the data, capturing notable insights, patterns, or potential interpretations.\n                ",
        "response": "The provided data consists of multiple rows, each representing CO2 emissions in Afghanistan (area ISO3: AFG) for a specific year, categorized according to the IPCC2006_PRIMAP classification.  Each row includes the following columns:  `source`, `scenario (PRIMAP-hist)`, `area (ISO3)`, `entity`, `unit`, `category (IPCC2006_PRIMAP)`, and a year followed by the corresponding CO2 emissions value in CO2 * gigagram / a.  For example, one row might state:  \"The PRIMAP-hist_v2.4 data source, using the HISTCR scenario, shows that Afghanistan (AFG) emitted 0.0 gigagrams of CO2 in 1750, categorized under 1.B.1.\"  Another row might say: \"According to the PRIMAP-hist_v2.4 data source, under the HISTCR scenario, Afghanistan (AFG) emitted 12.1 gigagrams of CO2 in 2021, categorized under 1.B.1.\"  A summary statement would note that CO2 emissions in Afghanistan are tracked by category (1.A, 1.B.1, 1.B.2, 2) and show significant increases from near zero in the 18th and much of the 19th century to values exceeding 10 gigagrams per year in the 2010s, varying across different IPCC categories.  The detailed analysis of each row requires individually processing each of the many rows provided.  A complete sentence description for every year for each category would be extremely lengthy."
