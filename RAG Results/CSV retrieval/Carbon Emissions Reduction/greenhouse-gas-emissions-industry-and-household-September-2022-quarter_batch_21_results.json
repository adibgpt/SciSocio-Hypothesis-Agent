        "response": "Row 1:  The Anzsic code BB1, representing the Mining industry, reported 354 kilotonnes of seasonally adjusted carbon dioxide equivalent gas emissions in 2022Q3, marked with a status of 'P'.  This indicates a relatively high level of emissions for the mining sector during that quarter.\n\nRow 2: The Anzsic code BB1 (Mining) showed 331 kilotonnes of seasonally adjusted carbon dioxide equivalent gas emissions in 2021Q4, also with a status of 'P'.  Compared to 2022Q3, this represents a decrease in emissions.\n\nRow 3: For Anzsic code BB1 (Mining) in 2022Q2, seasonally adjusted carbon dioxide equivalent gas emissions totaled 342 kilotonnes, again with a status of 'P'. This shows a slight increase compared to 2021Q4 but a decrease compared to 2022Q3.\n\nRow 4:  In 2022Q1, Anzsic code BB1 (Mining) registered 343 kilotonnes of seasonally adjusted carbon dioxide equivalent gas emissions, with a status of 'P'.  The emissions are slightly higher than in 2022Q2 but lower than in 2022Q3.\n\nRow 5:  Anzsic code BB1 (Mining) in 2021Q3 had 295 kilotonnes of seasonally adjusted carbon dioxide equivalent gas emissions and a status of 'P', indicating considerably lower emissions than in subsequent quarters.\n\n\nSummary: The data shows seasonally adjusted carbon dioxide equivalent emissions from the Mining (Anzsic BB1) sector between 2021Q3 and 2022Q3.  Emissions generally increased from 2021Q3 to 2022Q3, peaking in 2022Q3 at 354 kilotonnes.  The 'P' status for all entries suggests a consistent data reporting methodology but does not provide further information about its meaning without additional context."
