This reveals that despite significant carbon sequestration from land use change and forestry, transportation and manufacturing/construction were major contributors to overall emissions.\n\n**1996:**  In Afghanistan (AFG) during 1996, carbon dioxide emissions stemmed from buildings (170,000), industry (50,000), a net removal from land use change and forestry (-2,390,000), zero emissions from other fuel combustion, transport (700,000), manufacturing and construction (320,000), electricity and heat (170,000), and bunker fuels (20,000).  Similar to 1995, land use change and forestry acted as a significant carbon sink, while transport and manufacturing/construction remained substantial emission sources.\n\n**1997:**  Afghanistan (AFG) in 1997 saw carbon dioxide emissions originating from buildings (170,000), industry (50,000), a net removal due to land use change and forestry (-2,390,000), no emissions from other fuel combustion, transport (670,000), manufacturing and construction (300,000), electricity and heat (160,000), and bunker fuels (20,000).  The data again highlights the substantial carbon sequestration from land use change and forestry, while transport and manufacturing/construction remained significant emission sources, showing a slight decrease in transport emissions compared to 1996.\n\n**1998:** In Afghanistan (AFG) during 1998, the sources of carbon dioxide emissions included buildings (170,000), industry (50,000), a net removal from land use change and forestry (-2,390,000), no emissions from other fuel combustion, transport (670,000), manufacturing and construction (280,000), electricity and heat (160,000), and bunker fuels (20,000).  The pattern of high emissions from transport and manufacturing/construction continues, offset to some degree by the large carbon sink from land use change and forestry; transport emissions remained consistent with 1997.\n\n**1999:**  In Afghanistan (AFG) in 1999, carbon dioxide emissions were generated by buildings (170,000), industry (50,000), land use change and forestry resulted in a net removal of 2,390,000, other fuel combustion contributed 0, transport emitted 490,000, manufacturing and construction added 250,000, electricity and heat production released 160,000, and bunker fuels contributed 20,000.  This year shows a notable decrease in transport and manufacturing/construction emissions compared to previous years, further emphasizing the fluctuating nature of these emission sources within this period.\n\n\n**Summary:** The data consistently shows a massive net removal of CO2 due to land use change and forestry in Afghanistan throughout the period 1995-1999.  However,  transport and manufacturing/construction are significant emission sources, with some fluctuation in their contribution from year to year.  Industry emissions remain relatively constant. The lack of data for fugitive emissions from energy production limits a complete analysis."

        "response": "Here's an analysis of the provided data, presented as requested:\n\n\n**Row 1 (Africa, 2019):**  In 2019, Africa's carbon dioxide emissions totaled several billion tons, with transport contributing the most (364,610,020 tons), followed by land use change and forestry (1,244,020,000 tons), electricity and heat (604,410,000 tons), and manufacturing and construction (154,870,000 tons).  Other significant contributors included industry (78,270,000 tons), buildings (89,100,000 tons), other fuel combustion (27,510,000 tons), fugitive emissions from energy production (60,610,000 tons), and bunker fuels (43,800,000 tons).  This highlights the substantial impact of land use change and transport on Africa's carbon footprint in 2019.\n\n\n**Row 2 (Albania, 1992):** In 1992, Albania's carbon dioxide emissions were significantly lower than Africa's, with manufacturing and construction (760,000 tons) representing the largest source, followed by transport (410,000 tons), other fuel combustion (290,000 tons), electricity and heat (400,000 tons), buildings (280,000 tons), and land use change and forestry (180,000 tons), while industry contributed 100,000 tons and bunker fuels contributed none.  This indicates a relatively smaller overall carbon footprint for Albania compared to Africa in that year, with a heavier reliance on manufacturing and construction.\n\n\n**Row 3 (Africa, 2020):**  Africa's carbon dioxide emissions in 2020 showed a slight decrease in some sectors compared to 2019.  Land use change and forestry remained the dominant source (1,244,000,000 tons), followed by transport (334,660,000 tons), electricity and heat (549,870,000 tons), and manufacturing and construction (145,880,000 tons).  Emissions from industry (75,850,000 tons), buildings (88,580,000 tons), other fuel combustion (25,050,000 tons), and fugitive emissions from energy production (54,250,000 tons) were also recorded. Bunker fuels contributed 31,290,000 tons.  The data suggests a relatively stable contribution from land use change and forestry but a noticeable decrease in transport emissions between 2019 and 2020.\n\n\n**Row 4 (Albania, 1990):** In 1990, Albania's carbon dioxide emissions were primarily driven by manufacturing and construction (2,140,000 tons), followed by other fuel combustion (1,790,000 tons), transport (710,000 tons), buildings (310,000 tons), and electricity and heat (730,000 tons). Land use change and forestry contributed 180,000 tons, while industry contributed 380,000 tons and bunker fuels contributed none.  This shows a higher level of emissions from manufacturing and other fuel combustion than in subsequent years (1991 and 1992).\n\n\n**Row 5 (Albania, 1991):** Albania's 1991 carbon dioxide emissions show a decrease in manufacturing and construction (1,420,000 tons) and other fuel combustion (960,000 tons) compared to 1990, while transport (540,000 tons), buildings (360,000 tons), and electricity and heat (540,000 tons) all showed a decrease as well.  Industry contributed 310,000 tons, and land use change and forestry remained at 180,000 tons. Bunker fuels remained at zero. This suggests a potential economic downturn or shift in industrial activity between 1990 and 1991."

Also, there is missing data for \"Fugitive emissions of carbon dioxide from energy production\" in all rows.\n\n**Row 1 (Year 2002):**  In 2002, Albania (ALB) had carbon dioxide emissions from buildings of 620,000, industry of 0, land use change and forestry of -1,120,000, other fuel combustion of 550,000, transport of 1,770,000, manufacturing and construction of 430,000, electricity and heat of 390,000, and bunker fuels of 129,999.99.  This shows a net negative impact from land use and forestry, while transport and buildings contributed significantly to overall emissions, with industry emissions being notably absent.\n\n**Row 2 (Year 1999):** In 1999, Albania (ALB) recorded carbon dioxide emissions from buildings of 240,000, industry of 60,000, land use change and forestry of 180,000, other fuel combustion of 510,000, transport of 1,410,000, manufacturing and construction of 490,000, electricity and heat of 290,000, and bunker fuels of 110,000.  Compared to 2002, transport remained a significant contributor, but industry emissions were present, and land use change and forestry showed a positive impact.\n\n**Row 3 (Year 2001):** In 2001, Albania (ALB) had carbon dioxide emissions from buildings of 280,000, industry of 0, land use change and forestry of -1,120,000, other fuel combustion of 519,999.97, transport of 1,550,000, manufacturing and construction of 540,000, electricity and heat of 350,000, and bunker fuels of 129,999.99.  Similar to 2002,  industry emissions were absent, and land use and forestry showed a substantial negative contribution, with transport remaining a major source.\n\n**Row 4 (Year 2000):**  In 2000, Albania (ALB) showed carbon dioxide emissions from buildings of 259,999.98, industry of 90,000, land use change and forestry of 180,000, other fuel combustion of 510,000, transport of 1,470,000, manufacturing and construction of 470,000, electricity and heat of 380,000, and bunker fuels of 120,000.  This year shows a positive contribution from land use and forestry, with transport again being a significant contributor and industry emissions present, albeit lower than 1999.\n\n**Row 5 (Year 1998):** In 1998, Albania (ALB) had carbon dioxide emissions from buildings of 240,000, industry of 40,000, land use change and forestry of 180,000, other fuel combustion of 50,000, transport of 740,000, manufacturing and construction of 400,000, electricity and heat of 330,000, and bunker fuels of 0.  This year shows the lowest transport emissions and a significant positive contribution from land use and forestry, alongside relatively low emissions from other sectors.\n\n\nThe data reveals fluctuations in emissions from various sectors over the years.  Transport consistently appears as the largest source of emissions.  Land use change and forestry show both positive and negative contributions, possibly reflecting changes in forestry practices. Industry emissions show significant variation, sometimes being absent altogether.  The missing data for fugitive emissions prevents a complete picture."

This indicates that the largest contributors to CO2 emissions were electricity and heat production, followed by transport and fugitive emissions from energy production.\n\n\n**Row 2 (Year 1994):** In 1994, Algeria (DZA) showed carbon dioxide emissions of 8,170,000 from buildings, 2,820,000 from industry, 570,000 from land use change and forestry, 15,520,000 from transport, 5,970,000 from manufacturing and construction, 16,170,000 as fugitive emissions from energy production, 24,950,000 from electricity and heat, and 2,089,999.9 from bunker fuels, with no emissions from other fuel combustion.  Transport and electricity/heat production remained the largest emission sources, with slightly higher transport emissions compared to 1996.\n\n\n**Row 3 (Year 1995):**  Algeria (DZA) in 1995 had CO2 emissions of 8,090,000 from buildings, 3,170,000 from industry, 570,000 from land use change and forestry, 15,110,000 from transport, 6,260,000 from manufacturing and construction, 17,940,000 in fugitive emissions from energy production, 25,870,000 from electricity and heat, and 2,150,000 from bunker fuels;  emissions from other fuel combustion remained at zero.  Similar to previous years, electricity and heat, and transport sectors dominated CO2 emissions.\n\n\n**Row 4 (Year 1993):**  In 1993, Algeria (DZA) recorded carbon dioxide emissions of 8,229,999.5 from buildings, 2,990,000 from industry, 570,000 from land use change and forestry, 16,960,000 from transport, 6,230,000 from manufacturing and construction, 12,530,000 in fugitive emissions from energy production, 25,280,000 from electricity and heat, and 2,030,000 from bunker fuels, with no emissions reported from other fuel combustion. Notably, fugitive emissions from energy production were significantly lower than in subsequent years.\n\n\n**Row 5 (Year 1992):**  During 1992, Algeria (DZA) exhibited carbon dioxide emissions of 7,780,000 from buildings, 3,000,000 from industry, 570,000 from land use change and forestry, 16,800,000 from transport, 6,310,000 from manufacturing and construction, 8,890,000 in fugitive emissions from energy production, 24,060,000 from electricity and heat, and 2,150,000 from bunker fuels;  emissions from other fuel combustion sources were zero.  Fugitive emissions from energy production were considerably lower in 1992 compared to later years.\n\n\n**Summary:** The data shows that across the years 1992-1996, Algeria's CO2 emissions were consistently high, with transport and electricity/heat production as the primary contributors.  Fugitive emissions from energy production also represented a substantial portion, though this varied across the years.  Emissions from buildings, industry, and manufacturing/construction remained relatively stable, while transport emissions showed some fluctuation.  Land use change and forestry contributed a consistently smaller amount.  The absence of emissions from \"other fuel combustion\" throughout the period suggests a potential data reporting limitation or a specific characteristic of the Algerian energy sector during this time."

        "response": "Here's an analysis of the provided data, following the requested format:\n\n\n**1997:** In 1997, Antigua and Barbuda (ATG) reported carbon dioxide emissions of 10,000 from buildings, 0 from industry and land use change and forestry, 0 from other fuel combustion and manufacturing and construction, 129,999.99 from transport, 129,999.99 from electricity and heat, and 210,000 from bunker fuels.  This shows that transport and electricity/heat were the dominant sources of CO2 emissions, with bunker fuels contributing a significant portion.\n\n\n**1996:** In 1996, Antigua and Barbuda (ATG) had carbon dioxide emissions of 10,000 from buildings, 0 from industry and land use change and forestry, and other fuel combustion and manufacturing and construction, 129,999.99 from transport, 120,000 from electricity and heat, and 210,000 from bunker fuels.  Similar to 1997, transport and bunker fuels were major contributors, while electricity and heat production saw slightly lower emissions compared to the following year.\n\n\n**1995:**  Antigua and Barbuda (ATG)'s 1995 data reveals 10,000 in carbon dioxide emissions from buildings, 0 from industry, land use change and forestry, other fuel combustion, and manufacturing and construction, 120,000 from transport, 100,000 from electricity and heat, and 210,000 from bunker fuels.  Again, bunker fuels remained a constant high source, while transport and electricity/heat emissions were lower than in subsequent years.\n\n\n**1998:**  In 1998, Antigua and Barbuda (ATG) experienced carbon dioxide emissions of 10,000 from buildings, 0 from industry, land use change and forestry, other fuel combustion, and manufacturing and construction, 140,000 from transport, 140,000 from electricity and heat, and 210,000 from bunker fuels.  This year shows a notable increase in transport and electricity/heat emissions compared to previous years, while bunker fuel emissions remained consistent.\n\n\n**1994:** Antigua and Barbuda (ATG) in 1994 showed carbon dioxide emissions of 10,000 from buildings, 0 from industry, land use change and forestry, other fuel combustion, and manufacturing and construction, 110,000 from transport, 100,000 from electricity and heat, and 200,000 from bunker fuels. This year shows the lowest emissions across all categories except buildings, suggesting a possible upward trend in emissions in the following years.\n\n\n**Summary:** Across all years, bunker fuels consistently represent a substantial portion of Antigua and Barbuda's CO2 emissions.  Emissions from transport and electricity/heat production show an upward trend between 1994 and 1998, while emissions from buildings remain consistently low.  The lack of emissions from other sectors suggests a relatively simple economic structure with a heavy reliance on transportation and energy sectors."

This shows that transport, electricity and heat, and bunker fuels were the dominant sources of CO2 emissions in Antigua and Barbuda in 1999, while other sectors contributed minimally.\n\n**Row 2 (Year: 2000):** In 2000, Antigua and Barbuda (ATG) had 10,000 tons of CO2 emissions from buildings, 150,000 from transport, 160,000 from electricity and heat, and 210,000 from bunker fuels, with all other emission categories recording zero.  Similar to 1999, the majority of emissions stemmed from transport, electricity and heat, and bunker fuels, indicating a consistent emission pattern across these sectors.\n\n**Row 3 (Year: 2001):**  Antigua and Barbuda (ATG) in 2001 showed 10,000 tons of CO2 emissions from buildings, 150,000 from transport, 170,000 from electricity and heat, and 210,000 from bunker fuels; other sectors reported zero emissions.  This shows a slight increase in electricity and heat emissions compared to 2000, while transport and bunker fuel emissions remained stable.\n\n**Row 4 (Year: 2002):** In 2002, Antigua and Barbuda (ATG) recorded 10,000 tons of CO2 emissions from buildings, 150,000 from transport, 180,000 from electricity and heat, and 210,000 from bunker fuels; all other sectors reported zero emissions.  A continued, gradual increase in electricity and heat emissions is observed, suggesting potential growth in energy consumption.\n\n**Row 5 (Year: 2003):**  Antigua and Barbuda (ATG) in 2003 exhibited 10,000 tons of CO2 emissions from buildings, 160,000 from transport, 190,000 from electricity and heat, and 210,000 from bunker fuels, with zero emissions from all other sectors.  This year shows increases in both transport and electricity and heat emissions compared to the previous year, indicating potential economic growth and increased energy demand.\n\n\n**Summary:**  Across all five years (1999-2003), Antigua and Barbuda's CO2 emissions were consistently dominated by transport, electricity and heat, and bunker fuels, with minimal contributions from other sectors.  There is a clear upward trend in emissions from electricity and heat, and a slight increase in transport emissions over the period, suggesting a growth in energy consumption and economic activity.  The consistently high bunker fuel emissions suggest a significant reliance on maritime transport.  The lack of data on fugitive emissions from energy production limits a complete understanding of the overall emissions profile."
