        "response": "Here's an analysis of the provided data, following the requested format.  Note that the data is presented in a textual format, not a CSV, so the analysis is based on that.  Also, there is missing data for \"Fugitive emissions of carbon dioxide from energy production\" in all rows.\n\n**Row 1 (Year 2002):**  In 2002, Albania (ALB) had carbon dioxide emissions from buildings of 620,000, industry of 0, land use change and forestry of -1,120,000, other fuel combustion of 550,000, transport of 1,770,000, manufacturing and construction of 430,000, electricity and heat of 390,000, and bunker fuels of 129,999.99.  This shows a net negative impact from land use and forestry, while transport and buildings contributed significantly to overall emissions, with industry emissions being notably absent.\n\n**Row 2 (Year 1999):** In 1999, Albania (ALB) recorded carbon dioxide emissions from buildings of 240,000, industry of 60,000, land use change and forestry of 180,000, other fuel combustion of 510,000, transport of 1,410,000, manufacturing and construction of 490,000, electricity and heat of 290,000, and bunker fuels of 110,000.  Compared to 2002, transport remained a significant contributor, but industry emissions were present, and land use change and forestry showed a positive impact.\n\n**Row 3 (Year 2001):** In 2001, Albania (ALB) had carbon dioxide emissions from buildings of 280,000, industry of 0, land use change and forestry of -1,120,000, other fuel combustion of 519,999.97, transport of 1,550,000, manufacturing and construction of 540,000, electricity and heat of 350,000, and bunker fuels of 129,999.99.  Similar to 2002,  industry emissions were absent, and land use and forestry showed a substantial negative contribution, with transport remaining a major source.\n\n**Row 4 (Year 2000):**  In 2000, Albania (ALB) showed carbon dioxide emissions from buildings of 259,999.98, industry of 90,000, land use change and forestry of 180,000, other fuel combustion of 510,000, transport of 1,470,000, manufacturing and construction of 470,000, electricity and heat of 380,000, and bunker fuels of 120,000.  This year shows a positive contribution from land use and forestry, with transport again being a significant contributor and industry emissions present, albeit lower than 1999.\n\n**Row 5 (Year 1998):** In 1998, Albania (ALB) had carbon dioxide emissions from buildings of 240,000, industry of 40,000, land use change and forestry of 180,000, other fuel combustion of 50,000, transport of 740,000, manufacturing and construction of 400,000, electricity and heat of 330,000, and bunker fuels of 0.  This year shows the lowest transport emissions and a significant positive contribution from land use and forestry, alongside relatively low emissions from other sectors.\n\n\nThe data reveals fluctuations in emissions from various sectors over the years.  Transport consistently appears as the largest source of emissions.  Land use change and forestry show both positive and negative contributions, possibly reflecting changes in forestry practices. Industry emissions show significant variation, sometimes being absent altogether.  The missing data for fugitive emissions prevents a complete picture."
