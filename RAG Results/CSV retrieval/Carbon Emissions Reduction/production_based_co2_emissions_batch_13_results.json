        "response": "Germany (DEU), located in Europe's Northern Hemisphere, exhibited a decreasing trend in CO2e emissions per capita from 14.59 metric tons in 1990 to 9.72 metric tons in 2018, indicating a significant reduction in per capita emissions over nearly three decades.  Grenada (GRD), situated in the Northern Hemisphere of America, showed an upward trend in CO2e emissions per capita, rising from 16.29 metric tons in 1990 to 21.14 metric tons in 2018, suggesting increasing per capita emissions. Greece (GRC), also in Europe's Northern Hemisphere, experienced a decrease in CO2e emissions per capita from 9.39 metric tons in 1990 to a low of 7.68 metric tons in 2013 before a slight increase to 7.9 metric tons in 2018, illustrating a more complex emission pattern. Ghana (GHA), an African nation in the Northern Hemisphere, demonstrated a gradual increase in CO2e emissions per capita, from 0.85 metric tons in 1990 to 1.49 metric tons in 2018, reflecting a relatively low but growing carbon footprint. Finally, Guatemala (GTM), located in the Northern Hemisphere of America, displayed a general upward trend in CO2e emissions per capita, increasing from 1.23 metric tons in 1990 to 2.17 metric tons in 2018, indicating a notable rise in per capita emissions."
