        "response": "Here's an analysis of the provided data, presented as requested:\n\n\n**Row 1 (Year 2010):**  In 2010, Albania (ALB) had carbon dioxide emissions of 330,000 from buildings, 840,000 from industry, -1,120,000 from land use change and forestry (representing a net absorption), 250,000 from other fuel combustion, 2,240,000 from transport, 1,039,999.94 from manufacturing and construction, 100,000 from electricity and heat, and 50,000 from bunker fuels.  The significant transport emissions and net carbon absorption from land use and forestry are notable features in Albania's 2010 emissions profile.\n\n\n**Row 2 (Year 2009):** In 2009, Albania (ALB) recorded carbon dioxide emissions of 360,000 from buildings, 590,000 from industry, -1,120,000 from land use change and forestry (indicating a net carbon sink), 200,000 from other fuel combustion, 2,310,000 from transport, 780,000 from manufacturing and construction, 129,999.99 from electricity and heat, and 60,000 from bunker fuels.  Transport emissions remained high, while industry emissions were lower compared to 2010, and land use change and forestry continued to act as a significant carbon sink.\n\n\n**Row 3 (Year 2012):**  In 2012, Albania (ALB) had carbon dioxide emissions of 250,000 from buildings, 1,039,999.94 from industry, -850,000 from land use change and forestry (a net absorption, but less than previous years), 250,000 from other fuel combustion, 2,260,000 from transport, 640,000 from manufacturing and construction, 100,000 from electricity and heat, and 60,000 from bunker fuels.  Industry emissions increased substantially compared to 2009, while the carbon sink from land use and forestry decreased.\n\n\n**Row 4 (Year 2011):**  In 2011, Albania (ALB) experienced carbon dioxide emissions of 320,000 from buildings, 980,000 from industry, -850,000 from land use change and forestry (a net absorption), 250,000 from other fuel combustion, 2,360,000 from transport, 1,110,000 from manufacturing and construction, 120,000 from electricity and heat, and 60,000 from bunker fuels.  Transport emissions were the highest of the years provided, and industry emissions were considerably high.  The land use change and forestry sector continued to absorb carbon.\n\n\n**Row 5 (Year 2008):** In 2008, Albania (ALB) showed carbon dioxide emissions of 340,000 from buildings, 480,000 from industry, -1,120,000 from land use change and forestry (a significant carbon sink), 320,000 from other fuel combustion, 2,290,000 from transport, 500,000 from manufacturing and construction, 280,000 from electricity and heat, and 80,000 from bunker fuels.  While industry emissions were low, transport emissions were consistently high throughout this period, and the land use change and forestry sector consistently acted as a major carbon sink.\n\n\nNote:  Fugitive emissions from energy production are missing for all years.  There's a high degree of consistency in the land use, forestry and transport sectors across the years.  Industry and manufacturing/construction emissions fluctuate, indicating potential economic shifts."
