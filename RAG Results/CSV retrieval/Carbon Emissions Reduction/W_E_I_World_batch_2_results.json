        "response": "Here's an analysis of the provided data, presented as requested:\n\n\n**2015:** In 2015, the world saw 6 units of clean fuels, 568 units of generation, 906 units of power, 126 units of coal, and 385 units of gas.  This year shows a relatively high level of power generation compared to clean fuels, with coal and gas making up a significant portion of the overall energy mix.\n\n**2016:**  The year 2016 maintained a consistent level of clean fuels at 6 units, while generation slightly decreased to 566 units, and power increased to 917 units; coal usage dropped significantly to 105 units, and gas usage also decreased to 331 units.  A notable decrease in coal consumption is observed despite a slight increase in overall power generation.\n\n**2017:** In 2017, clean fuels remained at 6 units, generation decreased further to 555 units, and power dropped to 896 units; coal usage rebounded to 123 units, while gas usage continued its decline to 320 units. This year indicates a fluctuation in coal use despite relatively consistent clean fuel production.\n\n**2018:**  2018 showed a continued plateau in clean fuels at 6 units, a slight increase in generation to 562 units, and a minor increase in power to 897 units; coal usage remained relatively stable at 124 units, and gas consumption decreased further to 308 units.  Power generation remains relatively stable despite low clean fuel production and decreasing gas consumption.\n\n**2019:** The year 2019 saw a slight increase in clean fuels to 7 units, a notable increase in generation to 600 units, and a corresponding increase in power to 916 units; coal usage increased significantly to 145 units, while gas usage continued its decline to 296 units.  A notable increase in both generation and power is observed alongside a significant rise in coal use.\n\n**2020:** In 2020, clean fuels remained at 7 units, generation increased slightly to 605 units, and power increased marginally to 918 units; coal usage decreased to 132 units, and gas usage dropped significantly to 249 units.  Despite stable clean fuel production, a decrease in coal and gas use is observed.\n\n**2021:**  The year 2021 witnessed an increase in clean fuels to 8 units, a substantial increase in generation to 639 units, and a notable increase in power to 970 units; coal usage increased to 138 units, and gas usage saw a slight rebound to 254 units.  This year shows a clear upward trend in generation, power, and a slight increase in both coal and gas usage.\n\n**2022:** In 2022, there was a significant jump in clean fuels to 13 units, a substantial increase in generation to 773 units, and a significant increase in power to 1137 units; coal usage also increased to 153 units, and gas usage increased to 293 units.  This year shows a substantial increase across almost all categories, with a particularly strong jump in clean fuel production.\n\n**2023:**  2023 saw a further increase in clean fuels to 16 units, a substantial increase in generation to 893 units, and a significant increase in power to 1309 units; coal usage continued to rise to 162 units, and gas usage increased to 319 units. The upward trend continues across all categories in this year.\n\n**2024:**  In 2024, clean fuels increased to 21 units, generation reached 930 units, and power reached 1382 units; coal usage increased slightly to 165 units, and gas usage increased to 328 units.  Clean fuels show substantial growth, while coal and gas use remains relatively stable compared to the significant increase in overall power generation."
