        "response": "Here's an analysis of the provided data, following the requested format:\n\n\n**1997:** In 1997, Antigua and Barbuda (ATG) reported carbon dioxide emissions of 10,000 from buildings, 0 from industry and land use change and forestry, 0 from other fuel combustion and manufacturing and construction, 129,999.99 from transport, 129,999.99 from electricity and heat, and 210,000 from bunker fuels.  This shows that transport and electricity/heat were the dominant sources of CO2 emissions, with bunker fuels contributing a significant portion.\n\n\n**1996:** In 1996, Antigua and Barbuda (ATG) had carbon dioxide emissions of 10,000 from buildings, 0 from industry and land use change and forestry, and other fuel combustion and manufacturing and construction, 129,999.99 from transport, 120,000 from electricity and heat, and 210,000 from bunker fuels.  Similar to 1997, transport and bunker fuels were major contributors, while electricity and heat production saw slightly lower emissions compared to the following year.\n\n\n**1995:**  Antigua and Barbuda (ATG)'s 1995 data reveals 10,000 in carbon dioxide emissions from buildings, 0 from industry, land use change and forestry, other fuel combustion, and manufacturing and construction, 120,000 from transport, 100,000 from electricity and heat, and 210,000 from bunker fuels.  Again, bunker fuels remained a constant high source, while transport and electricity/heat emissions were lower than in subsequent years.\n\n\n**1998:**  In 1998, Antigua and Barbuda (ATG) experienced carbon dioxide emissions of 10,000 from buildings, 0 from industry, land use change and forestry, other fuel combustion, and manufacturing and construction, 140,000 from transport, 140,000 from electricity and heat, and 210,000 from bunker fuels.  This year shows a notable increase in transport and electricity/heat emissions compared to previous years, while bunker fuel emissions remained consistent.\n\n\n**1994:** Antigua and Barbuda (ATG) in 1994 showed carbon dioxide emissions of 10,000 from buildings, 0 from industry, land use change and forestry, other fuel combustion, and manufacturing and construction, 110,000 from transport, 100,000 from electricity and heat, and 200,000 from bunker fuels. This year shows the lowest emissions across all categories except buildings, suggesting a possible upward trend in emissions in the following years.\n\n\n**Summary:** Across all years, bunker fuels consistently represent a substantial portion of Antigua and Barbuda's CO2 emissions.  Emissions from transport and electricity/heat production show an upward trend between 1994 and 1998, while emissions from buildings remain consistently low.  The lack of emissions from other sectors suggests a relatively simple economic structure with a heavy reliance on transportation and energy sectors."
