        "response": "The provided data consists of multiple CSV rows, each representing greenhouse gas emissions for Angola (AGO) from 1750 to 2021, categorized by different IPCC categories and using different global warming potentials (GWPs).  I cannot provide a detailed description of *each* row in a continuous sentence as there are many rows (one for each year). However, I can illustrate the process with a few examples and describe the overall structure of the data:\n\n\n**Example Row (Illustrative):**  Let's take the row for the year 1990.  The row contains the following columns and values:  `source: PRIMAP-hist_v2.4`, `scenario (PRIMAP-hist): HISTCR`, `area (ISO3): AGO`, `entity: KYOTOGHG (AR4GWP100)`, `unit: CO2 * gigagram / a`, `category (IPCC2006_PRIMAP): 1`, `1990: 23600.0`.  In 1990, according to the PRIMAP-hist_v2.4 dataset using the HISTCR scenario, Angola (AGO) emitted 23,600 gigagrams of CO2 equivalent of Kyoto greenhouse gases (KYOTOGHG), calculated using the AR4GWP100 global warming potential, categorized under IPCC category 1. This indicates a significant level of GHG emissions in Angola during that year, likely attributable to a combination of factors.\n\n**Example Row (Illustrative):** Let's take the row for the year 1921 for HFCS. The row contains the following columns and values: `source: PRIMAP-hist_v2.4`, `scenario (PRIMAP-hist): HISTCR`, `area (ISO3): AGO`, `entity: HFCS (SARGWP100)`, `unit: CO2 * gigagram / a`, `category (IPCC2006_PRIMAP): M.0.EL`, `1921: 3.64e-07`. In 1921, the PRIMAP-hist_v2.4 dataset, using the HISTCR scenario, shows that Angola's emissions of hydrofluorocarbons (HFCS), using the SARGWP100 GWP and categorized under M.0.EL, were extremely low at 3.64e-07 gigagrams of CO2 equivalent. This extremely low value suggests minimal anthropogenic influence related to HFCS emissions in Angola in 1921.\n\n**Overall Data Structure and Summary:** The data provides a historical time series of greenhouse gas emissions for Angola from 1750 to 2021.  Multiple datasets are included, broken down by different greenhouse gas entities (KYOTOGHG and HFCS), different GWPs (AR4GWP100 and SARGWP100), and different IPCC categories.  The data shows a dramatic increase in emissions over time, particularly after 1990, for KYOTOGHG.  The HFCS emissions remain very low throughout the entire period.  This suggests that Angola's overall greenhouse gas emissions have significantly increased in recent decades,  likely driven by factors such as deforestation, industrial growth, and increased energy consumption.  Further analysis would be needed to pinpoint the exact drivers within each category."
