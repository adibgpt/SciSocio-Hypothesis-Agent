        "response": "Here's an analysis of the provided data, following the requested format:\n\n\n**Mexico (MEX):**  The ISO3 code MEX corresponds to Mexico, a country located in the Northern Hemisphere of the Americas.  Mexico's per capita CO2e emissions showed an increase from 5 metric tons in 1990 to a peak of 6.28 metric tons in 2005, before declining slightly to 5.39 metric tons in 2018, indicating a period of growth followed by a reduction in emissions.\n\n**Mauritania (MRT):**  The ISO3 code MRT represents Mauritania, an African nation situated in the Northern Hemisphere.  Mauritania's per capita CO2e emissions remained relatively stable between 2.81 and 3.08 metric tons from 1995 to 2013, experiencing a slight uptick to 3.2 metric tons in 2018, suggesting a generally consistent, low level of per capita emissions.\n\n**Malta (MLT):** The ISO3 code MLT identifies Malta, a European country in the Northern Hemisphere.  Malta's per capita CO2e emissions fluctuated between approximately 7 and 8 metric tons from 1990 to 2010 before a significant decrease to 4.2 metric tons in 2018;  this illustrates considerable variability and a substantial reduction in recent years.\n\n\n**Mali (MLI):**  The ISO3 code MLI refers to Mali, a country in Africa's Northern Hemisphere. Mali's per capita CO2e emissions remained consistently low, ranging from 1.67 to 1.82 metric tons between 1995 and 2010, with a modest increase to 2.29 metric tons in 2018, suggesting a slow but steady rise in emissions.\n\n**Mauritius (MUS):** The ISO3 code MUS corresponds to Mauritius, an African island nation located in the Southern Hemisphere.  Mauritius experienced a notable increase in per capita CO2e emissions from 2.02 metric tons in 1990 to 5.33 metric tons in 2018, showing a clear upward trend in emissions over the period."
