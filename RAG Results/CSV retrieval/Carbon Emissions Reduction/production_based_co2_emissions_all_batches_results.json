Note that this data only covers a limited time period and doesn't allow for broad generalizations about long-term trends.\n\n**Algeria (DZA):**  The ISO3 code DZA represents Algeria, an African country located in the Northern Hemisphere.  From 1990 to 2018, Algeria's metric tons of CO2e per capita increased from 3.5 to 5.18, showing a steady rise in per capita emissions over nearly three decades. This suggests a potential increase in industrial activity or energy consumption per person.\n\n**Antigua and Barbuda (ATG):**  Antigua and Barbuda (ATG), a country in America situated in the Northern Hemisphere, exhibited a consistent upward trend in CO2e per capita emissions from 6.31 metric tons in 1990 to 12.59 metric tons in 2018. This significant increase points to a substantial growth in per capita emissions, possibly linked to economic development or changes in energy sources.\n\n**Afghanistan (AFG):** Afghanistan (AFG), an Asian nation in the Northern Hemisphere, experienced fluctuating CO2e per capita emissions, with a noticeable decrease from 1.24 metric tons in 1990 to 0.76 metric tons in 2005, followed by a subsequent increase to 2.66 metric tons in 2018.  This volatile pattern may reflect the country's political and economic instability during this period.\n\n**Angola (AGO):** Angola (AGO), an African country located in the Southern Hemisphere, saw its CO2e per capita emissions rise from 4.29 metric tons in 1990 to a peak of 6.32 metric tons in 2010 before declining to 2.59 metric tons in 2018. This suggests a complex relationship between economic activity and emissions, potentially influenced by factors beyond per capita consumption.\n\n**Albania (ALB):** Albania (ALB), a European country in the Northern Hemisphere, showed a relatively stable, though fluctuating, level of CO2e per capita emissions, with a slight increase from 3.56 metric tons in 1990 to 3.52 metric tons in 2018.  This suggests a comparatively less dramatic change in per capita emissions compared to the other countries in the dataset."

In 1990, Australia's per capita CO2e emissions were 28.06 metric tons, which fluctuated to 27.28 in 1995, rose to 30.84 in 2000, then generally declined to 24.63 metric tons in 2018. This indicates a period of high emissions followed by a trend of reduction, although still remaining high compared to other countries listed.\n\n**Azerbaijan (AZE):**  The ISO3 code AZE represents Azerbaijan, an Asian country in the Northern Hemisphere.  While 1990 data is missing, per capita CO2e emissions started at 7.5 metric tons in 1995, generally decreased to 6.36 metric tons by 2010, before increasing again to 8.07 metric tons in 2018.  This shows an initial decline in emissions followed by a subsequent rise, suggesting potential economic shifts influencing energy consumption.\n\n**Argentina (ARG):** Argentina, with ISO3 code ARG, is an American country in the Southern Hemisphere. Its per capita CO2e emissions showed a gradual increase from 7.12 metric tons in 1990 to 8.22 metric tons in 2018, indicating a consistent, albeit slow, growth in emissions over the observed period. This suggests a steady increase in carbon footprint, likely linked to economic and population growth.\n\n**Austria (AUT):** Austria (AUT), a European country in the Northern Hemisphere, exhibited relatively stable per capita CO2e emissions, fluctuating around 9-10 metric tons throughout the period.  Emissions were 9.71 metric tons in 1990, peaking at 10.79 in 2005 before declining to 8.48 metric tons in 2018.  This suggests a period of relative stability with a more recent decrease in emissions, possibly due to environmental policies or shifts in energy sources.\n\n**Armenia (ARM):** Armenia (ARM), located in Asia and the Northern Hemisphere, shows a different trend.  While 1990 data is missing, per capita CO2e emissions increased from 1.94 metric tons in 1995 to 3.17 metric tons in 2018, signifying a steady growth in emissions over the period.
