        "response": "Here's an analysis of the provided data, presented as requested:\n\n\n**2016:** In 2016, Albania (ALB) reported carbon dioxide emissions of 400,000 from buildings, 880,000 from industry, a net reduction of 240,000 from land use change and forestry, 259,999.98 from other fuel combustion, 2,300,000 from transport, 610,000 from manufacturing and construction, 120,000 from electricity and heat, and 129,999.99 from bunker fuels.  Transport was the largest contributor to emissions, significantly exceeding all other sectors.  The net negative emissions from land use change and forestry indicate carbon sequestration.\n\n\n**2017:**  In 2017, Albania (ALB) showed increased emissions across multiple sectors compared to 2016, with building emissions at 460,000, industry at 1,010,000, a net reduction of 240,000 from land use change and forestry, 300,000 from other fuel combustion, 2,310,000 from transport, 1,100,000 from manufacturing and construction, 230,000 from electricity and heat, and 140,000 from bunker fuels.  Again, transport dominated emissions, and land use change and forestry showed a net carbon sink.  Manufacturing and construction showed the largest increase in emissions compared to the previous year.\n\n\n**2013:** In 2013, Albania (ALB) had carbon dioxide emissions of 330,000 from buildings, 1,130,000 from industry, a significant net reduction of 850,000 from land use change and forestry, 240,000 from other fuel combustion, 2,470,000 from transport, 580,000 from manufacturing and construction, 50,000 from electricity and heat, and 129,999.99 from bunker fuels. Transport remained the largest emitter, while land use change and forestry showed a substantial carbon sink, larger than in 2016 and 2017.\n\n\n**2015:**  Albania (ALB)'s 2015 emissions included 380,000 from buildings, 950,000 from industry, a net reduction of 850,000 from land use change and forestry, 259,999.98 from other fuel combustion, 2,450,000 from transport, 680,000 from manufacturing and construction, 80,000 from electricity and heat, and 70,000 from bunker fuels.  Similar to previous years, transport was the primary source of emissions, and land use change and forestry exhibited a substantial negative contribution.\n\n\n**2014:** In 2014, Albania (ALB) recorded 360,000 in carbon dioxide emissions from buildings, 1,050,000 from industry, a net reduction of 850,000 from land use change and forestry, 270,000 from other fuel combustion, 2,480,000 from transport, 920,000 from manufacturing and construction, 120,000 from electricity and heat, and 90,000 from bunker fuels.  Transport again constituted the largest source of emissions, with land use change and forestry showing consistent net negative emissions.\n\n\nNote:  Fugitive emissions from energy production are missing for all years.  A complete picture requires this data."
