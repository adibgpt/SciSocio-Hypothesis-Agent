        "response": "Here's an analysis of the provided data, following the requested format:\n\n\n**Row 1 (PER):**  The ISO3 code is PER, representing Peru, a country located in America within the Southern Hemisphere.  In 1990, Peru's per capita CO2e emissions were 1.94 metric tons, increasing steadily to 2.07 in 1995, 2.27 in 2000, 2.34 in 2005, 2.77 in 2010, 2.82 in 2013, and finally reaching 3.01 metric tons in 2018, indicating a consistent, albeit gradual, rise in per capita CO2e emissions over the period.  Summary: Peru shows a consistent increase in per capita CO2e emissions throughout the observed period.\n\n\n**Row 2 (POL):** The ISO3 code POL corresponds to Poland, a European country situated in the Northern Hemisphere.  Poland's per capita CO2e emissions started at 11.23 metric tons in 1990, decreased to 10.7 in 1995, and experienced further reductions to 9.4 in 2000 and 9.6 in 2005.  A slight increase is observed in 2010 (9.82 metric tons) and 2013 (9.43 metric tons), before rising again to 10.26 metric tons in 2018. Summary: Poland demonstrates fluctuating per capita CO2e emissions, with an initial decrease followed by a period of relative stability and a subsequent slight increase.\n\n\n**Row 3 (PNG):** Papua New Guinea (PNG), an Oceanian country in the Southern Hemisphere, is represented by the ISO3 code PNG. Its per capita CO2e emissions were 2.09 metric tons in 1990, rising to 2.68 in 1995, before declining to 2.31 in 2000, 2.22 in 2005, and 2.08 in 2010.  A slight increase to 2.16 metric tons was observed in 2013, followed by a rise to 2.67 metric tons in 2018. Summary: Papua New Guinea experienced fluctuating per capita CO2e emissions, with an initial increase followed by a period of decline and subsequent modest increases.\n\n\n**Row 4 (PHL):** The Philippines (PHL), an Asian country in the Northern Hemisphere, showed per capita CO2e emissions of 1.45 metric tons in 1990, gradually increasing to 1.68 in 1995, 1.73 in 2000, slightly decreasing to 1.67 in 2005 and 1.65 in 2010, before rising again to 1.74 in 2013 and 2.18 in 2018. Summary: The Philippines shows a generally increasing trend in per capita CO2e emissions over the observed period, with some minor fluctuations.\n\n\n**Row 5 (PRY):**  Paraguay (PRY), located in America and the Southern Hemisphere, had per capita CO2e emissions of 5.25 metric tons in 1990.  These emissions rose to 5.71 in 1995, then fell to 5.08 in 2000 and 4.92 in 2005.  A subsequent increase is seen in 2010 (5.56 metric tons) and 2013 (5.81 metric tons), culminating in 7.07 metric tons in 2018. Summary: Paraguay shows fluctuating per capita CO2e emissions with a general upward trend, particularly noticeable in the later years of the observed period."
