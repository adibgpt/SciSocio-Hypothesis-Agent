        "response": "Here's an analysis of the provided data, presented as requested:\n\n\n**2015:** In 2015, global renewable energy production stood at 343 units, while fossil fuels with carbon capture and storage (CCUS) were at 0 units, coal contributed 88 units, oil and natural gas contributed 94 units, and nuclear power generated 43 units.  This shows a significant reliance on fossil fuels (coal and oil/gas) alongside a substantial, though smaller, contribution from renewables and nuclear.\n\n**2016:**  The year 2016 saw a slight increase in renewable energy to 349 units, with fossil fuels with CCUS remaining at 0, coal production decreasing to 79 units, oil and natural gas staying relatively stable at 95 units, and nuclear energy production remaining consistent at 43 units.  The trend indicates a slow growth in renewables and a slight decline in coal use.\n\n**2017:** In 2017, renewable energy production continued its gradual increase to 354 units, fossil fuels with CCUS remained at 0, coal production further decreased to 72 units, oil and natural gas decreased to 88 units, and nuclear power slightly decreased to 41 units. This year shows continued, albeit modest, growth in renewables and a persistent decline in coal use.\n\n**2018:** During 2018, renewable energy experienced a more substantial increase to 379 units, while fossil fuels with CCUS were still at 0, coal production plateaued at 72 units, oil and natural gas decreased significantly to 72 units, and nuclear energy production further decreased to 39 units.  The data highlights accelerating growth in renewables alongside a continued decline in oil and gas and stagnation in coal.\n\n**2019:** The year 2019 showed a marked increase in renewable energy production to 424 units, maintaining the 0 units for fossil fuels with CCUS, while coal use slightly declined to 70 units, oil and natural gas decreased to 65 units, and nuclear power saw a slight increase to 40 units.  The trend of increasing renewable energy is quite pronounced, contrasting with the ongoing decline in fossil fuel use.\n\n**2020:** In 2020, renewable energy production reached 446 units, with fossil fuels with CCUS remaining at 0, coal production decreased to 64 units, oil and natural gas decreased substantially to 49 units, and nuclear power increased notably to 46 units.  This year showcases the continued strong growth of renewable energy and a significant drop in oil and gas usage, likely influenced by external factors (e.g., pandemic).\n\n**2021:**  2021 saw renewable energy production reach 470 units, still with 0 units from fossil fuels with CCUS, while coal production decreased further to 56 units, oil and natural gas showed a slight increase to 55 units, and nuclear power increased significantly to 58 units.  Renewables continued their upward trajectory, while coal continued its decline, and oil and gas showed some recovery.\n\n**2022:**  In 2022, renewable energy production experienced a substantial jump to 605 units, with fossil fuels with CCUS finally registering 1 unit, coal production decreased to 45 units, oil and natural gas slightly increased to 58 units, and nuclear power increased to 65 units. This year is noteworthy for the significant leap in renewable energy and the first appearance of fossil fuels with CCUS.\n\n**2023:** The year 2023 showed a continued strong increase in renewable energy production to 735 units, fossil fuels with CCUS remained at 1 unit, coal production decreased to 32 units, oil and natural gas slightly increased to 60 units, and nuclear power increased slightly to 66 units. The dominance of renewable energy growth continues, while coal use significantly declines.\n\n**2024:** In 2024, renewable energy production reached 771 units, fossil fuels with CCUS increased to 3 units, coal production decreased to 21 units, oil and natural gas slightly decreased to 57 units, and nuclear power increased to 78 units.  The trend of renewable energy dominance is undeniable, with coal use at its lowest point and a slight increase in both fossil fuels with CCUS and nuclear power."
