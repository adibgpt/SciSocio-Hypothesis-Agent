        "response": "Here's an analysis of the provided data, following the requested format.  Note that the data is presented in a textual format, not a CSV, making automated analysis difficult.  I will analyze each provided text block individually.\n\n\n**Africa, 1991:** In 1991, Africa's carbon dioxide emissions totaled over 1.6 billion tons, with land use change and forestry contributing the most (960,360,000 tons), followed by transport (117,560,000 tons), electricity and heat (247,780,000 tons), and manufacturing and construction (109,810,010 tons).  Buildings contributed 44,239,996 tons, industry 24,380,002 tons, other fuel combustion 9,690,001 tons, and bunker fuels 28,510,000 tons, while fugitive emissions from energy production reached 80,090,000 tons.  This highlights the significant impact of land use change and forestry on Africa's overall carbon emissions in 1991.\n\n\n**Afghanistan, 2020:** In 2020, Afghanistan's carbon dioxide emissions were significantly lower than Africa's in 1991, totaling approximately 8 million tons.  Transport was the largest contributor (3,260,000 tons), followed by manufacturing and construction (2,860,000 tons), buildings (2,360,000 tons), and land use change and forestry (150,000 tons).  Industry contributed a relatively small amount (60,000 tons), as did other fuel combustion (110,000 tons), electricity and heat (170,000 tons), and bunker fuels (20,000 tons).  Fugitive emissions from energy production data is missing.  The data reveals a much smaller carbon footprint for Afghanistan compared to Africa in 1991, likely reflecting differences in economic activity and industrial development.\n\n\n**Africa, 1993:**  Africa's carbon dioxide emissions in 1993 exceeded 1.5 billion tons, with land use change and forestry again being the dominant source (960,360,000 tons).  Transport contributed 122,450,000 tons, electricity and heat 265,970,000 tons, and buildings 47,690,000 tons.  Industry contributed 24,400,000 tons, other fuel combustion 11,870,000 tons, manufacturing and construction 98,890,000 tons, and bunker fuels 30,650,000 tons.  Fugitive emissions from energy production amounted to 86,689,990 tons.  Compared to 1991, there was a slight increase in most emission categories, suggesting continued growth in various sectors.\n\n\n**Africa, 1992:**  In 1992, Africa's carbon dioxide emissions remained relatively stable compared to 1991 and 1993, exceeding 1.5 billion tons. Land use change and forestry remained the largest contributor (960,360,000 tons).  Transport emissions were 123,369,990 tons, electricity and heat 253,550,000 tons, and buildings 45,270,000 tons.  Industry contributed 24,760,000 tons, other fuel combustion 9,670,000 tons, manufacturing and construction 106,540,000 tons, and bunker fuels 30,710,000 tons. Fugitive emissions from energy production were 80,540,000 tons.  The data suggests a relatively consistent pattern of emissions across these three years, with land use change and forestry consistently dominating.\n\n\n**Africa, 1990:**  In 1990, Africa's carbon dioxide emissions were slightly lower than in subsequent years, still exceeding 1.5 billion tons.  Land use change and forestry remained the largest source (960,360,000 tons).  Transport contributed 112,300,000 tons, electricity and heat 241,970,000 tons, and buildings 43,130,000 tons.  Industry contributed 22,770,000 tons, other fuel combustion 9,180,000 tons, manufacturing and construction 117,369,990 tons, and bunker fuels 28,090,000 tons.  Fugitive emissions from energy production were 70,380,000 tons.  This shows a slightly lower level of emissions across most sectors compared to the following years."
