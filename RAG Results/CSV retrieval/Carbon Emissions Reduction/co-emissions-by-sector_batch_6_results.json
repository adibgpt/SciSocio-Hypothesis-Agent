        "response": "Here's an analysis of the provided data, presented as requested:\n\n\n**2019:** In 2019, Afghanistan (AFG) had carbon dioxide emissions of 2,380,000 from buildings, 40,000 from industry, 150,000 from land use change and forestry, 150,000 from other fuel combustion, 4,530,000 from transport, 3,910,000 from manufacturing and construction, 240,000 from electricity and heat, and 30,000 from bunker fuels;  note that fugitive emissions from energy production are missing.  Transportation and manufacturing/construction were the largest contributors to CO2 emissions in Afghanistan during this year.\n\n\n**2016:**  In 2016, Afghanistan (AFG) recorded 2,600,000 tons of CO2 emissions from buildings, 80,000 from industry, 150,000 from land use change and forestry, 140,000 from other fuel combustion, 3,310,000 from transport, 2,980,000 from manufacturing and construction, 190,000 from electricity and heat, and 70,000 from bunker fuels; again, fugitive emissions from energy production are missing.  Similar to 2019, the transportation and manufacturing/construction sectors dominated CO2 emissions, although overall emissions appear lower than in 2019.\n\n\n**2017:** In 2017, Afghanistan's (AFG) CO2 emissions comprised 2,220,000 tons from buildings, 40,000 from industry, 150,000 from land use change and forestry, 140,000 from other fuel combustion, 3,940,000 from transport, 3,480,000 from manufacturing and construction, 190,000 from electricity and heat, and 190,000 from bunker fuels;  fugitive emissions from energy production are not provided.  Transportation and manufacturing/construction remained the primary sources of CO2 emissions, showing a slight increase compared to 2016.\n\n\n**2015:**  Afghanistan (AFG) in 2015 experienced CO2 emissions of 2,490,000 tons from buildings, 40,000 from industry, a net reduction of 250,000 tons from land use change and forestry (indicating carbon sequestration), 140,000 from other fuel combustion, 4,290,000 from transport, 2,930,000 from manufacturing and construction, 170,000 from electricity and heat, and 90,000 from bunker fuels; data on fugitive emissions from energy production is unavailable.  While transport and manufacturing/construction remained major contributors,  a notable feature is the negative value for land use change and forestry, suggesting a period of net carbon absorption.\n\n\n**2018:**  In 2018, Afghanistan (AFG) recorded CO2 emissions of 2,170,000 tons from buildings, 60,000 from industry, 150,000 from land use change and forestry, 230,000 from other fuel combustion, 4,410,000 from transport, 3,860,000 from manufacturing and construction, 240,000 from electricity and heat, and 170,000 from bunker fuels;  information on fugitive emissions from energy production is missing.  Transportation and manufacturing/construction again constituted the largest sources of emissions, with overall emissions appearing to fluctuate slightly year-to-year.\n\n\n**Summary:** Across all years, transportation and manufacturing/construction consistently represent the largest contributors to Afghanistan's CO2 emissions.  Land use change and forestry shows variability, including a period of carbon sequestration in 2015.  The missing data on fugitive emissions from energy production limits a complete analysis.  Overall emissions appear to fluctuate somewhat year to year, but a clear trend is not readily apparent from this limited data."
