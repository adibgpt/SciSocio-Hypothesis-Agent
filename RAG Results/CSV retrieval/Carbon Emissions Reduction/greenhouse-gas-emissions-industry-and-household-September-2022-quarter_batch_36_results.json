        "response": "Here's an analysis of the provided data, presented as requested:\n\n**Row 1:**  The Anzsic code DD1, representing Electricity, gas, water, and waste services, reported 2328 kilotonnes of seasonally adjusted carbon dioxide equivalent gas emissions in 2015Q1, marked with a status of 'P'.  This suggests a relatively high level of emissions for the industry during that quarter.\n\n**Row 2:**  For the Anzsic code DD1 (Electricity, gas, water, and waste services), 2075 kilotonnes of seasonally adjusted carbon dioxide equivalent gas emissions were recorded in 2014Q3, with a status of 'P'. This indicates a lower emission level compared to 2015Q1.\n\n**Row 3:** In 2014Q2, the Anzsic code DD1 (Electricity, gas, water, and waste services) showed 2168 kilotonnes of seasonally adjusted carbon dioxide equivalent gas emissions, marked with a 'P' status. This represents a value between the 2014Q3 and 2014Q4 figures.\n\n**Row 4:**  The Anzsic code DD1 (Electricity, gas, water, and waste services) registered 2029 kilotonnes of seasonally adjusted carbon dioxide equivalent gas emissions in 2014Q1, with a status of 'P'. This was the lowest emission level among the provided 2014 data points.\n\n**Row 5:**  In 2014Q4, the Anzsic code DD1 (Electricity, gas, water, and waste services) had 2162 kilotonnes of seasonally adjusted carbon dioxide equivalent gas emissions, marked with a 'P' status.  This value is similar to the 2014Q2 figure.\n\n**Summary:** The data shows seasonally adjusted carbon dioxide equivalent gas emissions from the Electricity, gas, water, and waste services (Anzsic DD1) sector between 2014Q1 and 2015Q1.  Emissions fluctuated throughout the period, with the highest value observed in 2015Q1 and the lowest in 2014Q1.  Further data would be needed to determine long-term trends and identify the factors driving these fluctuations.  The consistent 'P' status suggests a consistent data reporting method."
