        "response": "Here's an analysis of the provided data, following the requested format.  Note that there is no CSV file; the data is presented in a textual format.  The analysis will treat each textual block as a row.\n\n\n**Row 1 (Year 1997):**  In Albania (ALB) during 1997, carbon dioxide emissions totaled 2,160,000, comprised of  330,000 from buildings, 50,000 from industry, 180,000 from land use change and forestry, 40,000 from other fuel combustion, 490,000 from transport, 240,000 from manufacturing and construction, and 320,000 from electricity and heat; bunker fuel emissions were 0.  Transport and building emissions were significant contributors to the overall total.\n\n**Row 2 (Year 1995):** In Albania (ALB) in 1995,  CO2 emissions reached 1,730,000, with 250,000 from buildings, 100,000 from industry, 180,000 from land use change and forestry, 80,000 from other fuel combustion, a substantial 630,000 from transport, 490,000 from manufacturing and construction, and 400,000 from electricity and heat;  bunker fuel emissions were again 0. Transport and manufacturing/construction sectors were major emission sources.\n\n**Row 3 (Year 1993):**  Albania (ALB)'s CO2 emissions in 1993 amounted to 1,270,000, including 170,000 from buildings, 100,000 from industry, a consistent 180,000 from land use change and forestry, 220,000 from other fuel combustion, 510,000 from transport, 540,000 from manufacturing and construction, and 530,000 from electricity and heat, with no emissions from bunker fuels.  Manufacturing and construction, along with electricity and heat, were particularly high contributors in this year.\n\n**Row 4 (Year 1996):** In Albania (ALB) during 1996, CO2 emissions totalled 1,380,000, broken down as follows: 340,000 from buildings, 100,000 from industry, 180,000 from land use change and forestry, 110,000 from other fuel combustion, 620,000 from transport, 460,000 from manufacturing and construction, and 330,000 from electricity and heat; bunker fuel emissions remained at 0. Transport sector emissions consistently remained high.\n\n**Row 5 (Year 1994):**  Albania (ALB)'s CO2 emissions in 1994 were 1,600,000, consisting of 160,000 from buildings, 50,000 from industry, 180,000 from land use change and forestry, 170,000 from other fuel combustion, 640,000 from transport, 460,000 from manufacturing and construction, and a high 600,000 from electricity and heat, and 0 from bunker fuels.  Electricity and heat production was the largest emission source in this year."
