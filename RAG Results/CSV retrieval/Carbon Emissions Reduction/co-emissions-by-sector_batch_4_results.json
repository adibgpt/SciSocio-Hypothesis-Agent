        "response": "Here's an analysis of the provided data, presented as requested:\n\n\n**2005:** In 2005, Afghanistan (AFG) had carbon dioxide emissions of 240,000 from buildings, 10,000 from industry, 120,000 from land use change and forestry, 0 from other fuel combustion, 1,130,000 from transport, 350,000 from manufacturing and construction, 230,000 from electricity and heat, and 70,000 from bunker fuels;  this shows that transport was the largest source of CO2 emissions in 2005, significantly exceeding emissions from other sectors.\n\n**2006:** In 2006, Afghanistan (AFG) recorded carbon dioxide emissions of 230,000 from buildings, 10,000 from industry, 120,000 from land use change and forestry, 0 from other fuel combustion, 1,430,000 from transport, 350,000 from manufacturing and construction, 270,000 from electricity and heat, and 80,000 from bunker fuels;  similar to 2005, transport emissions dominated, showing a substantial increase compared to the previous year.\n\n**2007:**  In 2007, Afghanistan (AFG) experienced carbon dioxide emissions totaling 230,000 from buildings, 10,000 from industry, 120,000 from land use change and forestry, 0 from other fuel combustion, 1,600,000 from transport, 740,000 from manufacturing and construction, 270,000 from electricity and heat, and 110,000 from bunker fuels;  again, transport was the primary source of emissions, continuing the upward trend observed in previous years.  Manufacturing and construction emissions also increased.\n\n**2008:** During 2008, Afghanistan (AFG) saw carbon dioxide emissions of 230,000 from buildings, 20,000 from industry (a notable increase from previous years), 120,000 from land use change and forestry, 0 from other fuel combustion, 2,680,000 from transport (a significant jump), 1,210,000 from manufacturing and construction (a substantial increase), 240,000 from electricity and heat, and 160,000 from bunker fuels;  this year shows a dramatic increase in transport and manufacturing/construction emissions, indicating substantial economic activity or changes in transportation patterns.\n\n**2009:** In 2009, Afghanistan (AFG) had carbon dioxide emissions of 390,000 from buildings, 10,000 from industry, 120,000 from land use change and forestry, 0 from other fuel combustion, 4,370,000 from transport (a further increase), 1,670,000 from manufacturing and construction (another significant rise), 120,000 from electricity and heat, and 240,000 from bunker fuels;  transport emissions continued their sharp increase, representing the most significant contributor to Afghanistan's carbon footprint;  manufacturing and construction also showed substantial growth."
