        "response": "Here's an analysis of the provided data, presented as requested:\n\n\n**Row 1 (Year 1996):**  In 1996, Algeria (DZA) reported carbon dioxide emissions totaling 83,100,005 from buildings, 3,010,000 from industry, 570,000 from land use change and forestry, 14,960,000 from transport, 5,880,000 from manufacturing and construction, 18,230,000 as fugitive emissions from energy production, 25,740,000 from electricity and heat, and 2,010,000 from bunker fuels;  other fuel combustion emissions were 0.  This indicates that the largest contributors to CO2 emissions were electricity and heat production, followed by transport and fugitive emissions from energy production.\n\n\n**Row 2 (Year 1994):** In 1994, Algeria (DZA) showed carbon dioxide emissions of 8,170,000 from buildings, 2,820,000 from industry, 570,000 from land use change and forestry, 15,520,000 from transport, 5,970,000 from manufacturing and construction, 16,170,000 as fugitive emissions from energy production, 24,950,000 from electricity and heat, and 2,089,999.9 from bunker fuels, with no emissions from other fuel combustion.  Transport and electricity/heat production remained the largest emission sources, with slightly higher transport emissions compared to 1996.\n\n\n**Row 3 (Year 1995):**  Algeria (DZA) in 1995 had CO2 emissions of 8,090,000 from buildings, 3,170,000 from industry, 570,000 from land use change and forestry, 15,110,000 from transport, 6,260,000 from manufacturing and construction, 17,940,000 in fugitive emissions from energy production, 25,870,000 from electricity and heat, and 2,150,000 from bunker fuels;  emissions from other fuel combustion remained at zero.  Similar to previous years, electricity and heat, and transport sectors dominated CO2 emissions.\n\n\n**Row 4 (Year 1993):**  In 1993, Algeria (DZA) recorded carbon dioxide emissions of 8,229,999.5 from buildings, 2,990,000 from industry, 570,000 from land use change and forestry, 16,960,000 from transport, 6,230,000 from manufacturing and construction, 12,530,000 in fugitive emissions from energy production, 25,280,000 from electricity and heat, and 2,030,000 from bunker fuels, with no emissions reported from other fuel combustion. Notably, fugitive emissions from energy production were significantly lower than in subsequent years.\n\n\n**Row 5 (Year 1992):**  During 1992, Algeria (DZA) exhibited carbon dioxide emissions of 7,780,000 from buildings, 3,000,000 from industry, 570,000 from land use change and forestry, 16,800,000 from transport, 6,310,000 from manufacturing and construction, 8,890,000 in fugitive emissions from energy production, 24,060,000 from electricity and heat, and 2,150,000 from bunker fuels;  emissions from other fuel combustion sources were zero.  Fugitive emissions from energy production were considerably lower in 1992 compared to later years.\n\n\n**Summary:** The data shows that across the years 1992-1996, Algeria's CO2 emissions were consistently high, with transport and electricity/heat production as the primary contributors.  Fugitive emissions from energy production also represented a substantial portion, though this varied across the years.  Emissions from buildings, industry, and manufacturing/construction remained relatively stable, while transport emissions showed some fluctuation.  Land use change and forestry contributed a consistently smaller amount.  The absence of emissions from \"other fuel combustion\" throughout the period suggests a potential data reporting limitation or a specific characteristic of the Algerian energy sector during this time."
