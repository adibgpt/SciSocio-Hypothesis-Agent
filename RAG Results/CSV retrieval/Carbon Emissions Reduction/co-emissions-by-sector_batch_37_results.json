        "response": "Here's an analysis of the provided data, presented as requested:\n\n\n**Row 1 (Year 2019):**  In Angola (AGO) during 2019, carbon dioxide emissions totaled 64,860,000,  comprising 3,710,000 from buildings, 960,000 from industry, a substantial 35,480,000 from land use change and forestry, 30,000 from other fuel combustion, 7,930,000 from transport, 1,510,000 from manufacturing and construction, 4,510,000 from fugitive emissions in energy production, 5,740,000 from electricity and heat, and 1,970,000 from bunker fuels.  Land use change and forestry were the dominant source of emissions in 2019.\n\n\n**Row 2 (Year 2015):** In Angola (AGO) in 2015,  CO2 emissions reached 66,120,500, with 4,860,000 stemming from buildings, 2,030,000 from industry, a significant 35,500,000 from land use change and forestry, 50,000 from other fuel combustion, 7,980,000 from transport, 2,200,000 from manufacturing and construction, 8,100,000 from fugitive emissions in energy production, 6,420,000 from electricity and heat, and 2,560,000 from bunker fuels.  Similar to 2019, land use change and forestry were the primary source of emissions. Fugitive emissions from energy production were higher in 2015 compared to 2019.\n\n\n**Row 3 (Year 2017):**  Angola (AGO)'s CO2 emissions in 2017 amounted to 60,060,000, consisting of 3,500,000 from buildings, 1,000,000 from industry, a considerable 35,500,000 from land use change and forestry, 30,000 from other fuel combustion, 6,720,000 from transport, 1,360,000 from manufacturing and construction, 7,350,000 from fugitive emissions in energy production, 5,100,000 from electricity and heat, and 2,020,000 from bunker fuels.  Again, land use change and forestry were the most significant contributor to emissions.\n\n\n**Row 4 (Year 2018):** In Angola (AGO) during 2018, CO2 emissions totaled 59,719,999.94,  including 3,240,000 from buildings, 1,039,999.94 from industry, 35,500,000 from land use change and forestry, 30,000 from other fuel combustion, 6,950,000 from transport, 1,930,000 from manufacturing and construction, 5,400,000 from fugitive emissions in energy production, 5,060,000 from electricity and heat, and 1,980,000 from bunker fuels. Land use change and forestry remained the largest source of emissions, with relatively consistent figures across the years.\n\n\n**Row 5 (Year 2016):**  Angola (AGO)'s CO2 emissions in 2016 reached 61,110,000, composed of 4,330,000 from buildings, 1,500,000 from industry, 35,500,000 from land use change and forestry, 40,000 from other fuel combustion, 7,910,000 from transport, 2,480,000 from manufacturing and construction, 8,690,000 from fugitive emissions in energy production, 4,570,000 from electricity and heat, and 2,020,000 from bunker fuels.  Land use change and forestry were the most significant contributor to emissions, with fugitive emissions from energy production being relatively high for this year.\n\n\n**Summary of all rows:**  Across all years (2015-2019), Angola's CO2 emissions remained relatively consistent, with land use change and forestry consistently representing the largest source of emissions.  Other significant contributors included transport, electricity and heat, and fugitive emissions from energy production.  There is some year-to-year fluctuation in emissions from buildings, industry, and manufacturing and construction."
