        "response": "Here's an analysis of the provided data, presented as requested:\n\n\n**Albania (ALB), 2020:**  In 2020, Albania (ALB) had carbon dioxide emissions of 460,000 from buildings, 990,000 from industry, a net reduction of 250,000 from land use change and forestry, 290,000 from other fuel combustion, 1,530,000 from transport, and 980,000 from manufacturing and construction;  electricity and heat contributed 129,999.99, and bunker fuels added 150,000.  Fugitive emissions from energy production are not specified.  Transportation was the largest source of emissions in Albania in 2020.\n\n\n**Algeria (DZA), 1991:** In 1991, Algeria (DZA) recorded carbon dioxide emissions of 7,540,000 from buildings, 2,970,000 from industry, 570,000 from land use change and forestry, 0 from other fuel combustion, 16,880,000 from transport, 6,230,000 from manufacturing and construction, 8,730,000 in fugitive emissions from energy production, 24,080,000 from electricity and heat, and 2,160,000 from bunker fuels.  Transportation and electricity/heat generation were the dominant sources of emissions in Algeria during 1991.\n\n\n**Albania (ALB), 2018:** In 2018, Albania (ALB) showed carbon dioxide emissions of 470,000 from buildings, 930,000 from industry, a net reduction of 240,000 from land use change and forestry, 290,000 from other fuel combustion, 2,210,000 from transport, and 1,280,000 from manufacturing and construction; electricity and heat contributed 140,000, and bunker fuels added 120,000.  Fugitive emissions from energy production are unspecified. Transport emissions increased significantly compared to the previous data points.\n\n\n**Albania (ALB), 2019:**  Albania (ALB)'s 2019 carbon dioxide emissions included 480,000 from buildings, 930,000 from industry, a net reduction of 250,000 from land use change and forestry, 300,000 from other fuel combustion, 2,190,000 from transport, and 910,000 from manufacturing and construction;  electricity and heat contributed 190,000, and bunker fuels added 160,000. Fugitive emissions from energy production are not provided.  Transport remained a major source of emissions, while manufacturing and construction emissions decreased slightly compared to 2018.\n\n\n**Algeria (DZA), 1990:**  In 1990, Algeria (DZA) had carbon dioxide emissions totaling 6,590,000 from buildings, 2,990,000 from industry, 570,000 from land use change and forestry, 0 from other fuel combustion, 15,810,000 from transport, 5,680,000 from manufacturing and construction, 8,770,000 in fugitive emissions from energy production, 23,100,000 from electricity and heat, and 2,470,000 from bunker fuels.  Similar to 1991, transport and electricity/heat generation were the largest contributors to emissions in Algeria in 1990."
