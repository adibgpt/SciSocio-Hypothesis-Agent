The latter requires large, perhaps prohibitively large subsidies. The central estimate of the costs of climate policy, unrealistically assuming least-cost implementation, is 3.8-5.6% of GDP in 2100. The central estimate of the benefits of climate policy, unrealistically assuming constant vulnerability, is 2.8-3.2% of GDP. The uncertainty about the benefits is larger than the uncertainty about the costs. The Paris targets do not pass the cost-benefit test unless risk aversion is high and discount rate low.\n\n3. **Main Idea and Hypothesis:** The paper conducts a cost-benefit analysis of the Paris Agreement's temperature targets. The underlying hypothesis is that a rigorous cost-benefit assessment can determine whether these targets are economically justifiable.\n\n4. **Summary of Results:** The paper finds that, under the assumptions of least-cost implementation and constant vulnerability, the costs of meeting the Paris targets (3.8-5.6% of GDP in 2100) exceed the benefits (2.8-3.2% of GDP in 2100).  The targets are only justified with high risk aversion and low discount rates.  The large uncertainty around benefit estimates is highlighted.\n\n\n**Paper 41:**\n\n1. **Title:** Carbon Intensity-Aware Adaptive Inference of DNNs\n\n2. **Abstract:** DNN inference, known for its significant energy consumption and the resulting high carbon footprint, can be made more sustainable by adapting model size and accuracy to the varying carbon intensity throughout the day. Our heuristic algorithm uses larger, high-accuracy models during low-intensity periods and smaller, lower-accuracy ones during high-intensity periods. We also introduce a metric, carbon-emission efficiency, which quantitatively measures the efficacy of adaptive model selection in terms of carbon footprint. The evaluation showed that the proposed approach could improve the carbon emission efficiency in improving the accuracy of vision recognition services by up to 80%.\n\n3. **Main Idea and Hypothesis:** The paper proposes an adaptive inference method for deep neural networks (DNNs) that adjusts model complexity based on real-time carbon intensity. The hypothesis is that this adaptive approach will reduce the overall carbon footprint of DNN inference without significantly sacrificing accuracy.\n\n4. **Summary of Results:** The proposed adaptive approach significantly improved carbon emission efficiency compared to using a single DNN model.

We estimated that a 7.9% reduction in emissions for 4 months would result in a 0.25 ppm decrease in the Northern Hemisphere CO2, an increment that is within the capability of current CO2 analyzers, but is a few times smaller than natural CO2 variabilities caused by weather and the biosphere such as El Nino. We used a state-of-the-art atmospheric transport model to simulate CO2, driven by a new daily fossil fuel emissions dataset and hourly biospheric fluxes from a carbon cycle model forced with observed climate variability. Our results show a 0.13 ppm decrease in atmospheric column CO2 anomaly averaged over 50S-50N for the period February-April 2020 relative to a 10-year climatology. A similar decrease was observed by the carbon satellite GOSAT3. Using model sensitivity experiments, we further found that COVID, the biosphere and weather contributed 54%, 23%, and 23% respectively. In May 2020, the CO2 anomaly continued to decrease and was 0.36 ppm below climatology, mostly due to the COVID reduction and a biosphere that turned from a relative carbon source to carbon sink, while weather impact fluctuated. This seemingly small change stands out as the largest sub-annual anomaly in the last 10 years. Measurements at marine boundary layer stations such as Cape Kumukahi, Hawaii exhibit 1-2 ppm anomalies, mostly due to weather and biosphere. At city scale, on-road CO2 enhancement measured in Beijing shows reduction of 20-30 ppm, consistent with drastically reduced traffic during the lockdown, while station data suggest that the expected COVID signal of 5-10 ppm was swamped by weather-driven variability on multi-day time scales. By contrast, a clear stepwise drop of 10-20 ppm at the city-wide lockdown was observed in the city of Chengdu where weather is less variable. The ability of our current carbon monitoring systems in detecting the small and short-lasting COVID signal on the background of fossil fuel CO2 accumulated over the last two centuries is encouraging. The COVID-19 pandemic is an unintended experiment whose impact suggests that to keep atmospheric CO2 at a climate-safe level will require sustained effort of similar magnitude and improved accuracy and expanded spatiotemporal coverage of our monitoring systems.\n\n3. **Main Idea and Hypothesis:** The paper investigates the detectable impact of the COVID-19 lockdown on atmospheric CO2 concentrations. The hypothesis is that the significant reduction in emissions during the lockdown would lead to a measurable decrease in atmospheric CO2, even considering the influence of natural variability.\n\n4. **Summary of Results:**  The study found a 0.13 ppm decrease in atmospheric CO2 anomaly (50S-50N) during February-April 2020, consistent with GOSAT satellite observations. Model sensitivity experiments attributed 54% of the decrease to the COVID-19 emissions reduction, with the biosphere and weather playing smaller roles.  At the city level, the COVID-19 signal was masked by weather variability in some cities (Beijing) but clearly detectable in others (Chengdu) with less variable weather.  The study concludes that current monitoring systems can detect the relatively small impact of the short-lived lockdown, highlighting the need for sustained efforts and improved monitoring capabilities to achieve climate goals.",
