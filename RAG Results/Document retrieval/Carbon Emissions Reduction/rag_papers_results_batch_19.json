FedGreen: Carbon-aware Federated Learning with Model Size Adaptation**\n\n1. **Title:** FedGreen: Carbon-aware Federated Learning with Model Size Adaptation\n\n2. **Abstract:** Federated learning (FL) provides a promising collaborative framework to build a model from distributed clients, and this work investigates the carbon emission of the FL process. Cloud and edge servers hosting FL clients may exhibit diverse carbon footprints influenced by their geographical locations with varying power sources, offering opportunities to reduce carbon emissions by training local models with adaptive computations and communications. In this paper, we propose FedGreen, a carbon-aware FL approach to efficiently train models by adopting adaptive model sizes shared with clients based on their carbon profiles and locations using ordered dropout as a model compression technique. We theoretically analyze the trade-offs between the produced carbon emissions and the convergence accuracy, considering the carbon intensity discrepancy across countries to choose the parameters optimally. Empirical studies show that FedGreen can substantially reduce the carbon footprints of FL compared to the state-of-the-art while maintaining competitive model accuracy.\n\n3. **Main Idea and Hypothesis:** The main idea is to reduce the carbon footprint of federated learning (FL) by adapting the size of models sent to clients based on their location's carbon intensity.  The hypothesis is that by sending smaller models to clients in high-carbon-intensity locations and larger models to those in low-carbon-intensity locations, the overall carbon emissions of the FL training process can be significantly reduced without sacrificing model accuracy.\n\n4. **Summary of Results:**  FedGreen, using ordered dropout for model compression, effectively reduced carbon emissions in FL compared to FedAvg.  Experiments showed a correlation between reduced mean scaling rate (smaller models), lower carbon emission costs, and increased global epochs.  The standard deviation of scaling rates also impacted the number of epochs needed for convergence, particularly with highly non-IID data.  The optimal scaling rates were found to depend on the data heterogeneity and target accuracy.\n\n\n**2. Achieving Dispatchability in Data Centers: Carbon and Cost-Aware Sizing of Energy Storage and Local Photovoltaic Generation**\n\n1. **Title:** Achieving Dispatchability in Data Centers: Carbon and Cost-Aware Sizing of Energy Storage and Local Photovoltaic Generation\n\n2. **Abstract:** Data centers are large electricity consumers. Reducing their carbon footprint and demand stochasticity is important. This work provides a method to size a PhotoVoltaic (PV) system and an Energy Storage System (ESS) for an existing data center looking to reduce both its carbon footprint and demand stochasticity via dispatching. The proposed scenario-based optimization framework allows to size the ESS and the PV system to minimize the expected operational and capital costs, along with the carbon footprint of the data center complex. The life cycle assessment of the resources, as well as the dynamic carbon emissions of the upstream power distribution grid, are accounted for while computing the day-ahead planning of the data center aggregated demand and PV generation. Case studies in different Swiss cantons and regions of Germany emphasize the need for location-aware sizing processes since the obtained optimal solutions strongly depend on the local electricity carbon footprint, cost and on the local irradiance conditions. Some regions show potential in carbon footprint reduction, while other regions do not.\n\n3. **Main Idea and Hypothesis:** The main idea is to optimize the size of on-site PV generation and energy storage systems (ESS) for data centers to minimize both operational costs and carbon emissions while maintaining dispatchability (the ability to meet a pre-determined power demand profile). The hypothesis is that a scenario-based optimization approach, considering the stochastic nature of electricity prices, carbon intensity, solar irradiance, and data center demand, will yield optimal sizes for PV and ESS that achieve this cost and emission reduction.\n\n4. **Summary of Results:** The proposed optimization framework successfully sized PV and ESS for data centers in various Swiss and German locations. The optimal sizes were highly location-dependent due to variations in electricity prices, carbon intensity, and solar irradiance.  In some regions (e.g., Bayern, Germany), significant carbon footprint reductions were possible, while in others (e.g., Aargau, Switzerland), the reductions were minimal or even negative due to the already low carbon intensity of the local grid. The optimal battery power-to-energy ratio was also found to be location-dependent.\n\n\n**3. Upgrading Urban Water Storage System: Achieving Water Conservation, Power Generation, Carbon Reduction, and Water Quality Enhancement**\n\n1. **Title:** Upgrading Urban Water Storage System: Achieving Water Conservation, Power Generation, Carbon Reduction, and Water Quality Enhancement\n\n2. **Abstract:**  Not explicitly provided, but the introduction summarizes the main points.\n\n3. **Main Idea and Hypothesis:** The main idea is to address Beijing's water scarcity, electricity demand, and carbon neutrality goals by covering surface reservoirs and water channels with solar panels. The hypothesis is that this approach will simultaneously conserve water (by reducing evaporation), generate electricity, reduce carbon emissions (by replacing fossil fuel-based electricity), and improve water quality (by reducing harmful algae and bromate).\n\n4. **Summary of Results:** Based on calculations using government data and small-scale experiments, the proposed plan is estimated to save 383 million m\u00b3 of water annually, generate 72.6 billion kWh of electricity, reduce CO2 emissions by 6.84 billion kg, and significantly reduce microcystin concentrations.  The experimental results supported the hypothesis, showing reductions in evaporation, cyanobacteria growth, and bromate production. However, the experimental setup was limited in scale and lacked precise measurement equipment for microcystins and bromate.\n\n\n**4. Low-Carbon Economic Dispatch of Bulk Power Systems Using Nash Bargaining Game**\n\n1. **Title:** Low-Carbon Economic Dispatch of Bulk Power Systems Using Nash Bargaining Game\n\n2. **Abstract:** Decarbonization of power systems plays a crucial role in achieving carbon neutral goals across the globe, but there exists a sharp contradiction between the emission reduction and levelized generation cost. Therefore, it is of great importance for power system operators to take economic as well as low-carbon factors into account. This paper establishes a low-carbon economic dispatch model of bulk power systems based on Nash bargaining game, which derives a Nash bargaining solution making a reasonable trade-off between economic and low-carbon objectives. Because the Nash bargaining solution satisfies Pareto effectiveness, we analyze the computational complexity of Pareto frontiers with parametric linear programming and interpret the inefficiency of the method. Instead, we assign a group of dynamic weights in the objective function of the proposed low-carbon economic dispatch model so as to improve the computational efficiency by decoupling time periods and avoiding the complete computation of Pareto frontiers. In the end, we validate the proposed model and the algorithm by a realistic nationwide simulation in mainland China.\n\n3. **Main Idea and Hypothesis:** The paper aims to develop a low-carbon economic dispatch (LCED) model for bulk power systems that balances economic efficiency with emission reduction. The hypothesis is that a Nash bargaining game approach, which finds a Pareto-optimal solution representing a trade-off between cost and emissions, will provide a more reasonable and efficient solution than traditional weighted sum methods.\n\n4. **Summary of Results:** A low-carbon economic dispatch model based on the Nash bargaining game was developed.  Analysis showed that directly computing the Pareto frontier using parametric linear programming is computationally expensive. A dynamic weight algorithm was proposed to improve computational efficiency by iteratively searching for the Nash bargaining solution.  A nationwide simulation in mainland China demonstrated the model's effectiveness in finding a cost-effective solution that significantly reduced both cost and emissions compared to scenarios focused solely on cost or emissions. The simulated carbon tax was significantly higher than the current market price, suggesting the need for stronger carbon management policies in China.\n\n\n**5. Applying endogenous learning models in energy system optimization**\n\n1. **Title:** Applying endogenous learning models in energy system optimization\n\n2. **Abstract:** Conventional energy production based on fossil fuels causes emissions which contribute to global warming. Accurate energy system models are required for a cost-optimal transition to a zero-emission energy system, an endeavor that requires an accurate modeling of cost reductions due to technological learning effects. In this review, we summarize common methodologies for modeling technological learning and associated cost reductions. The focus is on learning effects in hydrogen production technologies due to their importance in a low-carbon energy system, as well as the application of endogenous learning in energy system models. Finally, we present an overview of the learning rates of relevant low-carbon technologies required to model future energy systems.\n\n3. **Main Idea and Hypothesis:** The paper reviews methodologies for modeling technological learning (specifically learning-by-doing and learning-by-research) and their application in energy system optimization models. The underlying hypothesis is that accurately incorporating learning effects into these models is crucial for providing reliable cost forecasts and optimal transition pathways to a zero-emission energy system.\n\n4. **Summary of Results:** The review summarizes different learning curve models (one-factor, two-factor, composite), highlighting their strengths and weaknesses.  A comprehensive literature review on learning rates for various energy technologies (photovoltaics, wind, biofuels, hydrogen production, carbon capture, energy storage) is presented, revealing a significant spread in reported learning rates and emphasizing the importance of considering uncertainty.  The review discusses challenges in applying endogenous learning models in energy system optimization, including data limitations, the need for implementation speed constraints, and the potential for biased results due to simplifying assumptions.  The authors highlight the need for more accurate and up-to-date data on learning rates, especially for emerging technologies like hydrogen production.",
