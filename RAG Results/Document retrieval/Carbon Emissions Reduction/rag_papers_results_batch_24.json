Note that some sections may be incomplete due to missing information in the excerpts.\n\n\n**Paper 1: Reward-penalty Mechanism for Reverse Supply Chain Network with Asymmetric Information and Carbon Emission Constraints**\n\n1. **Title:** Reward-penalty Mechanism for Reverse Supply Chain Network with Asymmetric Information and Carbon Emission Constraints\n\n2. **Abstract:**  The paper investigates the government's reward and penalty mechanism in a reverse supply chain with competing retailers, asymmetric information (retailer's private information on costs and recycling rate), and carbon emission constraints.  It analyzes five game models with varying coordination and power structures.\n\n3. **Main Idea and Hypothesis:** The main idea is to determine the optimal design parameters for a government reward-penalty mechanism that incentivizes retailers to recycle more waste electrical and electronic equipment (WEEE), considering asymmetric information and carbon emission targets. The hypothesis is that a combined reward-penalty mechanism for both carbon emissions and recycling rates will be more effective than a mechanism focused solely on carbon emissions.\n\n4. **Summary of Results:** The paper concludes that a combined reward-penalty mechanism for carbon emissions and recycling leads to higher recycling rates and buy-back prices compared to a mechanism focused only on emissions.  Carbon emission constraints increase new product selling prices. The relationship between selling prices under different reward-penalty mechanisms is not definitive.  The retailer's buy-back price is influenced by the manufacturer's carbon emissions regardless of the retailer's fixed cost. Under certain conditions, the buy-back price under the combined mechanism is higher than under the emission-only constraint.\n\n\n**Paper 2: Maintaining Performance with Less Data**\n\n1. **Title:** Maintaining Performance with Less Data\n\n2. **Abstract:** The paper proposes novel methods for dynamically reducing input data during neural network training for image classification, aiming to reduce training costs (time, hardware, and environmental impact).\n\n3. **Main Idea and Hypothesis:** The main idea is to explore whether dynamically reducing the amount of data used during training can maintain or even improve model accuracy while significantly reducing training time and, consequently, carbon emissions. The hypothesis is that carefully controlled data reduction during training can mitigate the negative impact of reduced data on model performance.\n\n4. **Summary of Results:** Three novel dynamic data reduction methods (Data Step, Data Increment, Data Cut) are tested on three datasets (MNIST, CIFAR-10, smallNORB).  The Data Step method showed slight accuracy improvements on MNIST in some cases, while CIFAR-10 and smallNORB showed accuracy decreases correlated with data reduction.  The Data Increment and Data Cut methods generally showed accuracy decreases compared to the baseline, with the Data Cut method showing the most significant runtime reduction but also the largest accuracy loss.  The study provides evidence that these methods can reduce training resources by over 50% while maintaining or sometimes improving accuracy.\n\n\n**Paper 3: Experimental and numerical study on the effect of oxymethylene ether-3 (OME3) on soot particle formation**\n\n1. **Title:** Experimental and numerical study on the effect of oxymethylene ether-3 (OME3) on soot particle formation\n\n2. **Abstract:** The paper investigates the effect of oxymethylene ether-3 (OME3) on soot particle formation when blended with ethylene in premixed flames.  Experimental (particle size distribution, LIF, LII) and numerical (CQMOM with D\u2019Anna soot model) methods were used.\n\n3. **Main Idea and Hypothesis:** The main idea is to characterize the sooting properties of OME3 as a fuel additive to reduce soot emissions. The hypothesis is that OME3, due to its high oxygen content and lack of C-C bonds, will reduce soot formation compared to pure ethylene.\n\n4. **Summary of Results:**  Experiments showed a reduction in the total amount and size of soot particles at all equivalence ratios when OME3 was added, while the number of small nanoparticles remained relatively unchanged.  The CQMOM model predicted similar trends for soot volume fraction and the general shape of the particle size distribution. Spectroscopic analysis revealed lower aromaticity and a higher presence of C=O functionalities in soot from OME3-blended flames.\n\n\n**Paper 4: A Study of Cooling Time Reduction of Interferometric Cryogenic Gravitational Wave Detectors Using a High-Emissivity Coating**\n\n1. **Title:** A Study of Cooling Time Reduction of Interferometric Cryogenic Gravitational Wave Detectors Using a High-Emissivity Coating\n\n2. **Abstract:** The paper explores the use of a high-emissivity coating (DLC) to reduce the cooling time of cryogenic gravitational wave detectors.  Calculations and experiments are presented to verify the effect.\n\n3. **Main Idea and Hypothesis:** The main idea is to reduce the cooling time of large payloads in cryogenic gravitational wave detectors to increase the observation duty factor. The hypothesis is that applying a high-emissivity coating will enhance radiation heat transfer and significantly shorten the cooling time.\n\n4. **Summary of Results:** Calculations showed that a DLC coating could reduce cooling time from two months to one month. Experiments using half-sized payloads and spheres confirmed the effect of the coating, showing faster cooling with the DLC coating. The emissivity of the DLC coating was found to be temperature-dependent.  Further research is needed to find materials with even higher emissivity and vacuum compatibility.",
