The effect of inhomogeneous carbon prices on the cost-optimal design of a simplified European power system**\n\n1. **Title:** The effect of inhomogeneous carbon prices on the cost-optimal design of a simplified European power system\n2. **Abstract:** Carbon prices are one of the most prominent methods to reduce global greenhouse gas emissions and have been adopted by several countries around the world. However, regionally different carbon prices can lead to carbon leakage. In this paper, a simplified European power system where carbon prices are varied with respect to GDP per capita is investigated. The findings show inhomogeneous carbon prices leading to significant carbon leakage due to coal-fired generation remaining a major source of power in Eastern Europe. From the results it can be concluded that inhomogeneous carbon prices are a potential risk for European long-term decarbonisation targets.\n3. **Main Idea and Hypothesis:** The paper investigates how regionally varying carbon prices affect the cost-optimal design of a European power system, hypothesizing that inhomogeneous carbon prices will lead to carbon leakage, with emissions shifting to regions with lower carbon prices.\n4. **Summary of Results:** The study finds that inhomogeneous carbon prices lead to significant carbon leakage to Eastern Europe, where coal-fired generation persists due to lower carbon prices.  This undermines overall decarbonization efforts. Even with high base carbon prices, coal remains a significant energy source in Eastern Europe under this scenario.  The cost-optimal system, while lower overall, still shows high emissions due to this leakage.\n\n\n**34. Abominable greenhouse gas bookkeeping casts serious doubts on climate intentions of oil and gas companies**\n\n1. **Title:** Abominable greenhouse gas bookkeeping casts serious doubts on climate intentions of oil and gas companies\n2. **Abstract:** The Paris Agreement aims to reach net zero greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in the second half of the 21st century, and the Oil & Gas sector plays a key role in achieving this transition. Understanding progress in emission reductions in the private sector relies on the disclosure of corporate climate-related data, and the Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP) is considered a leader in this area. Companies report voluntarily to CDP, providing total emissions and breakdowns into categories. How reliable are these accounts? Here, we show that their reliability is likely very poor. A significant proportion of Oil & Gas companies\u2019 emission reports between 2010 and 2019 fail a \u2018simple summation\u2019 mathematical test that identifies if the breakdowns add up to the totals. Companies\u2019 reports reflect unbalanced internal bookkeeping in 38.9% of cases, which suggests worryingly low quality standards for data guiding the private sector\u2019s contribution to halting climate change.\n3. **Main Idea and Hypothesis:** The paper investigates the reliability of greenhouse gas emission reporting by oil and gas companies to the Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP), hypothesizing that a significant portion of these reports contain errors or inconsistencies.\n4. **Summary of Results:** The analysis reveals significant inconsistencies in the reported data.  A substantial percentage (38.9%) of reports failed a simple summation test, indicating errors in the bookkeeping of emissions breakdowns.  A further analysis suggests that in some cases, the errors were biased towards underreporting emissions. The authors conclude that the quality of self-reported data is poor, raising concerns about the accuracy of information used to assess the industry's climate action.  Voluntary assurance of data did not show improvement in data quality.\n\n\n**35. A Microgrid Deployment Framework to Support Drayage Electrification**\n\n1. **Title:** A Microgrid Deployment Framework to Support Drayage Electrification\n2. **Abstract:** The electrification of heavy-duty commercial vehicles (HDCVs) is pivotal in reducing greenhouse gas emissions and urban air pollution; however, this transition poses significant challenges for the existing electric grid, which is not designed to meet the high electricity demands of HDCVs. This can lead to a less effective reduction in freight transportation\u2019s carbon intensity despite significant electrification efforts. Deploying renewable energy sources, such as photovoltaics, alongside energy storage solutions, is essential to address these challenges. This paper examines the current grid limitations and explores the critical role of microgrid deployment, integrating solar and battery energy storage systems, in supporting the electrification of HDCVs. We propose an integrated framework that is designed to enhance regional grid capacity and decrease carbon intensity by identifying viable sites where a microgrid can be deployed and provide estimates for the deployment cost. Furthermore, using this framework, we quantify the maximal impact of microgrid deployment in reducing CO2 emissions when we optimize the use of the available power. As a demonstration, we apply our framework to the region of the Port of Savannah, GA USA.\n3. **Main Idea and Hypothesis:** The paper proposes a framework for deploying microgrids with solar and battery storage to support the electrification of heavy-duty commercial vehicles (HDCVs), hypothesizing that microgrids can alleviate grid strain, reduce carbon emissions, and improve the effectiveness of HDCV electrification.\n4. **Summary of Results:** The framework successfully identifies viable sites for microgrid deployment and estimates the associated costs. The optimization shows that significant CO2 emission reductions (over 80%) are possible through optimal power distribution from renewable sources, while also achieving cost reductions for the fleet operator. The case study on the Port of Savannah demonstrates the framework's applicability and potential impact.  The paper also explores the optimal combination of solar and battery technologies for cost-effectiveness and emission reduction.\n\n\n**36.  Fleet Level Environmental Evaluation Tool (FLEET)** (This is a composite summary from multiple excerpts related to the FLEET model)\n\n1. **Title:** (Various titles related to FLEET, as it's a model rather than a single paper)\n2. **Abstract:** Not consistently provided in excerpts.  Abstracts across the multiple papers describe the FLEET model's capabilities for predicting the evolution of commercial aviation CO2 emissions under various scenarios.\n3. **Main Idea and Hypothesis:** The FLEET model simulates the impact of economic growth, aircraft technology advancements, and environmental regulations on airline fleet operations and CO2 emissions.  The underlying hypothesis is that these factors interact in complex ways to determine future emissions, and the model can accurately predict these interactions.\n4. **Summary of Results:** The simulations show that CO2 emissions are highly sensitive to economic growth and aircraft technology.  Scenarios with high economic growth and low technological advancement lead to significant increases in CO2 emissions.  Conversely, scenarios with high technological advancement and moderate economic growth show potential for reducing emissions below 2005 levels. However, none of the scenarios fully meet the International Air Transport Association (IATA) goals for CO2 emission reduction.  Noise limitations at airports also significantly affect the results, reducing overall emissions.",
