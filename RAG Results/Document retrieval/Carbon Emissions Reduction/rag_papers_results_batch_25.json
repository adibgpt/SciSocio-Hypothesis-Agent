Prior work proposes metrics that quantify computing\u2019s carbon footprint across several lifecycle phases, including its supply chain, operation, and end-of-life. Industry uses these metrics to optimize the carbon footprint of manufacturing hardware and running computing applications. Unfortunately, prior work on optimizing datacenters\u2019 carbon footprint often succumbs to the sunk cost fallacy by considering embodied carbon emissions (a sunk cost) when making operational decisions (i.e., job scheduling and placement), which leads to operational decisions that do not always reduce the total carbon footprint.  In this paper, we evaluate carbon-aware job scheduling and placement on a given set of servers for a number of carbon accounting metrics. Our analysis reveals state-of-the-art carbon accounting metrics that include embodied carbon emissions when making operational decisions can actually increase the total carbon footprint of executing a set of jobs. We study the factors that affect the added carbon cost of such suboptimal decision-making. We then use a real-world case study from a datacenter to demonstrate how the sunk carbon fallacy manifests itself in practice. Finally, we discuss the implications of our findings in better guiding effective carbon-aware scheduling in on-premise and cloud datacenters.\n\n3. **Main idea and hypothesis:** The paper hypothesizes that existing carbon accounting metrics, which include embodied carbon in operational decisions (like job scheduling), suffer from the sunk cost fallacy, leading to suboptimal decisions that increase overall datacenter carbon footprint.  The hypothesis is that focusing solely on minimizing operational carbon emissions during scheduling, while keeping procurement decisions separate, will result in lower overall carbon emissions.\n\n4. **Summary of Results:** The paper demonstrates that metrics like SCI (Software Carbon Intensity), which incorporate embodied carbon, can lead to choosing less energy-efficient servers for jobs, thus increasing the overall datacenter carbon footprint.  This is because embodied carbon is a sunk cost irrelevant to operational decisions.  The study shows that focusing on operational carbon intensity (oSCI) leads to better scheduling outcomes and lower overall carbon emissions. A real-world case study supports these findings.  The paper concludes that procurement and scheduling decisions should be decoupled and optimized independently to avoid the \"sunk carbon fallacy.\"\n\n\n**Paper 2:**\n\n1. **Title:** Impact of the Inflation Reduction Act and Carbon Capture on Transportation Electrification for a Net-Zero Western U.S. Grid\n\n2. **Abstract:**  The electrification of transportation is critical to mitigate Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions. The United States (U.S.) government\u2019s Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) of 2022 introduces policies to promote the electrification of transportation. In addition to electrifying transportation, clean energy technologies such as Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) may play a major role in achieving a net-zero energy system. Utilizing scenarios simulated by the U.S. version of the Global Change Analysis Model (GCAM-USA), we analyze the individual and compound contributions of the IRA and CCS to reach a clean U.S. grid by 2035 and net-zero GHG emissions by 2050. We analyze the contributions based on three metrics: i) transportation electrification rate, ii) transportation fuel mix, and iii) spatio-temporal charging loads. Our findings indicate that the IRA significantly accelerates transportation electrification in the near-term (until 2035). In contrast, CCS technologies, by enabling the continued use of internal combustion vehicles while still advancing torward net-zero, potentially suppresses the rate of transportation electrification in the long-term. This study underscores how policy and technology innovation can interact and sensitivity studies with different combination are essential to characterize the potential contributions of each to the transportation electrification.\n\n3. **Main idea and hypothesis:** The paper investigates the combined and individual effects of the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) and Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) technologies on transportation electrification in the Western U.S.  The hypothesis is that the IRA will significantly increase transportation electrification in the short term, while CCS may reduce the long-term need for such electrification by enabling continued use of fossil fuels with reduced emissions.\n\n4. **Summary of Results:** The IRA significantly accelerates transportation electrification, particularly for LDVs (light-duty vehicles), until around 2035. CCS technologies, however, potentially suppress the long-term need for electrification as they allow for continued use of fossil fuels with reduced emissions. The study provides detailed data on electrification rates, fuel mix, and spatio-temporal charging loads, highlighting the importance of considering both IRA and CCS for comprehensive decarbonization strategies. The interaction between the IRA and CCS is complex, and the relative contributions vary across different time horizons and vehicle types.\n\n\n**Paper 3:**\n\n1. **Title:** An Emissions Trading System to reach NDC targets in the Chilean electric sector\n\n2. **Abstract:** In the context of the Paris Agreement, Chile has pledged to reduce Greenhouse Gases (GHG) intensity by at least 30% below 2007 levels by 2030, and to phase out coal as a energy source by 2040, among other strategies. In pursue of these goals, Chile has implemented a $5 per tonne of CO2 emission tax, \ufb01rst of its kind in Latin America. However, such a low price has proven to be insu\ufb03cient. In our work, we study an alternative approach for capping and pricing carbon emissions in the Chilean electric sector; the cap and trade paradigm. We model the Chilean electric market (generators and emissions auctioneer) as a two stage capacity expansion equilibrium problem, where we allow future investment and trading of emission permits among generator agents. The model studies generation and future investments in the Chilean electric sector in two regimes of demand: deterministic and stochastic. We show that the current Chilean Greenhouse Gases (GHG) intensity pledge does not drive an important shift in the future Chilean electric matrix. To encourage a shift to greener technologies, a more stringent carbon budget must be considered, resulting in a carbon price approximately ten times higher than the present one. We also show that achieving the emissions reduction goal does not necessarily results in further reductions of carbon generation, or phasing out coal in the longer term. Finally, we demonstrate that under technology change costs reductions, higher demand scenarios will relax the need for stringent carbon budgets to achieve new renewable energy investments and hence meet the Chilean pledges. These results suggest that some aspects of the Chilean pledge require further analysis, of the economic impact, particularly with the recent announcement of achieving carbon neutrality towards 2050.\n\n\n3. **Main idea and hypothesis:** The paper investigates whether Chile's current emission reduction policies are sufficient to meet its Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) under the Paris Agreement. The hypothesis is that Chile's existing carbon tax is insufficient, and a more stringent cap-and-trade system with a significantly higher carbon price is necessary to achieve its NDCs, particularly the coal phase-out goal.\n\n4. **Summary of Results:** The study finds that Chile's current GHG intensity pledge and carbon tax are not sufficient to significantly shift the energy mix towards renewable sources. A much more stringent carbon budget (and consequently, a higher carbon price \u2013 approximately ten times higher than the current tax) is needed to incentivize a substantial shift to renewable energy and achieve the coal phase-out target.  The analysis considers both deterministic and stochastic demand scenarios, showing that even with lower technology costs, a stringent carbon budget is necessary to meet the NDCs.  The paper highlights the economic implications of these findings, particularly regarding the cost of stranded assets.",
