We introduce a framework that makes this easier by providing a simple interface for tracking realtime energy consumption and carbon emissions, as well as generating standardized online appendices. Utilizing this framework, we create a leaderboard for energy efficient reinforcement learning algorithms to incentivize responsible research in this area as an example for other areas of machine learning. Finally, based on case studies using our framework, we propose strategies for mitigation of carbon emissions and reduction of energy consumption. By making accounting easier, we hope to further the sustainable development of machine learning experiments and spur more research into energy efficient algorithms.\n\n3. **Main idea and hypothesis:** The main idea is to address the lack of consistent energy and carbon footprint reporting in machine learning research. The hypothesis is that the complexity of collecting these metrics is a major barrier to their widespread reporting.  A simplified framework would improve reporting and incentivize more energy-efficient practices.\n\n4. **Summary of Results:** The authors developed the `experiment-impact-tracker` framework for easier and more accurate reporting of energy, compute, and carbon metrics.  They found that commonly used efficiency metrics like FPOs are poorly correlated with actual energy consumption across different architectures.  They created a reinforcement learning energy leaderboard to encourage efficient algorithm development and demonstrated significant energy savings are possible by simply choosing more energy-efficient algorithms and running experiments in low-carbon regions.\n\n\n**Paper 2: Contributions of Individual Generators to Nodal Carbon Emissions**\n\n1. **Title:** Contributions of Individual Generators to Nodal Carbon Emissions\n\n2. **Abstract:** Recent shifts toward sustainable energy systems have witnessed the fast deployment of carbon-free and carbon-efficient generations across the power networks. However, the benefits of carbon reduction are not experienced evenly throughout the grid. Each generator can have distinct carbon emission rates. Due to the existence of physical power flows, nodal power consumption is met by a combination of a set of generators, while such combination is determined by network topology, generators\u2019 characteristics and power demand. This paper describes a technique based on physical power flow model, which can efficiently compute the nodal carbon emissions contributed by each single generator given the generation and power flow information. We also extend the technique to calculate both the nodal average carbon emission and marginal carbon emission rates. Simulation results validate the effectiveness of the calculations, while our technique provides a fundamental tool for applications such as carbon auditing, carbon-oriented demand management and future carbon-oriented capacity expansion.\n\n3. **Main idea and hypothesis:** The main idea is to develop an efficient method to calculate the nodal carbon emissions contributed by individual generators in a power grid. The hypothesis is that a method based on physical power flow models can accurately and efficiently compute both nodal average and marginal carbon emission rates.\n\n4. **Summary of Results:** The authors developed a recursive algorithm based on depth-first search to trace the carbon emission contribution of each generator to each node and line flow. The algorithm efficiently calculates nodal average and marginal carbon emission rates. Simulation results on IEEE 6-bus and 30-bus systems validated the algorithm's accuracy and efficiency, showing significant variations in nodal carbon emission rates.\n\n\n**Paper 3: Identifying Operation Equilibrium in Integrated Electricity, Natural Gas, and Carbon-Emission Markets**\n\n1. **Title:** Identifying Operation Equilibrium in Integrated Electricity, Natural Gas, and Carbon-Emission Markets\n\n2. **Abstract:** The decarbonization of the power sector plays a pivotal role in economy-wide decarbonization to set the world on track to limit warming to 1.5\u00b0C by 2050. Carbon emission markets can play a significant role in this transition by putting a price on carbon and giving electricity producers an incentive to reduce their emissions. In this paper, we study the operational equilibrium of an integrated regional/jurisdictional energy system that comprises an electricity market, a natural gas market, and a carbon emission market. We first propose the novel role of a regional carbon market operator (CMO). Different than the conventional cap-and-trade carbon trading mechanism, the proposed CMO manages carbon allowance trading in a centralized jurisdictional carbon emission market. We then develop the formulation to identify the operational equilibrium of the electricity, natural gas, and carbon emission markets based on their interactions. The proposed equilibrium can be obtained by solving the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions of all three operational models simultaneously. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed approach is more flexible, consistent, and effective in mitigating carbon emissions compared with the cap-and-trade mechanism.\n\n3. **Main idea and hypothesis:** The main idea is to model the operational equilibrium of integrated electricity, natural gas, and carbon emission markets to optimize for both economic efficiency and emissions reduction. The hypothesis is that a model incorporating a centralized regional carbon market operator (CMO) will be more effective in mitigating carbon emissions than the conventional cap-and-trade mechanism.\n\n4. **Summary of Results:** The authors proposed a novel role for a regional CMO managing a centralized carbon allowance market. They developed an optimization model to find the operational equilibrium of the integrated energy system, solving the KKT conditions of the three markets simultaneously. Simulation results showed that the proposed model is superior to the traditional cap-and-trade approach in terms of flexibility, consistency, and effectiveness in emission reduction, particularly in handling electricity demand growth and renewable generation adoption.  The model allows for a quantitative balancing of social welfare and decarbonization goals.\n\n\n**Paper 4: Well-to-Tank Country-Level Marine Fuel CI**\n\n1. **Title:** Well-to-Tank Country-Level Marine Fuel CI (A Preprint)\n\n2. **Abstract:** Not explicitly provided in excerpt.\n\n3. **Main idea and hypothesis:** The main idea is to analyze the well-to-tank carbon intensity (CI) variability of marine fuels (HSFO and refinery-sourced LPG) across different countries. The implicit hypothesis is that CI varies significantly across countries due to differences in upstream operations, refining processes, and transportation distances, and that a single default CI value is insufficient for accurate assessment.\n\n4. **Summary of Results:** The study found significant variations in well-to-tank CI for HSFO and refinery-sourced LPG across countries. Upstream operations (extraction and flaring) and refining efficiency were identified as major drivers of this variability. The global average WTT CI for HSFO was 12.4 gCO2e/MJ, while for refinery-sourced LPG (exit gate), it was 15.6 gCO2e/MJ. The study highlights the need for detailed country-level data and targeted mitigation efforts (flaring reduction, carbon capture, etc.) to accurately assess and reduce maritime emissions.  Data gaps regarding non-refinery LPG sources were acknowledged as a limitation.",
