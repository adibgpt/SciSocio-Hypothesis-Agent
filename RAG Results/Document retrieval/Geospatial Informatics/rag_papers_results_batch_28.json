Active Geospatial Search for Efficient Tenant Eviction Outreach**\n\n1. **Title:** Active Geospatial Search for Efficient Tenant Eviction Outreach\n\n2. **Abstract:** Tenant evictions threaten housing stability.  This paper proposes a novel active geospatial search (AGS) framework to improve outreach programs targeting at-risk tenants. AGS uses property-level information in a search policy to identify rental units to canvas, balancing exploration and exploitation while accounting for travel costs and budget constraints.  Evaluation using eviction data demonstrates the framework's effectiveness in identifying eviction cases.\n\n3. **Main idea and hypothesis:** The main idea is to develop a more efficient method for identifying tenants at risk of eviction to maximize the impact of limited outreach resources. The underlying hypothesis is that an active learning approach, which strategically selects which properties to investigate based on predicted risk and cost, will outperform methods that rely on random selection or simple heuristics.\n\n4. **Summary of Results:** The hierarchical AGS (HAGS) framework significantly outperforms baseline methods (random, greedy, greedy adaptive, conventional active search) in identifying at-risk properties, especially in scenarios with limited budgets or scarce eviction cases.  The integration of visual and tabular data further enhances performance.  HAGS demonstrates the potential for data-driven approaches to improve the effectiveness and timeliness of eviction prevention programs.\n\n\n**2. On the use of adversarial validation for quantifying dissimilarity in geospatial machine learning prediction**\n\n1. **Title:** On the use of adversarial validation for quantifying dissimilarity in geospatial machine learning prediction\n\n2. **Abstract:** Geospatial ML model evaluation via cross-validation (CV) is affected by the dissimilarity between sample data and prediction locations. This paper proposes a method (DAV) to quantify this dissimilarity using adversarial validation. Experiments using synthetic and real datasets show that DAV effectively quantifies dissimilarity.  The study also compares RDM-CV, BLK-CV, and SP-CV, showing that RDM-CV is most accurate when dissimilarity is low, while geospatial CV methods improve as dissimilarity increases.\n\n3. **Main idea and hypothesis:** The main idea is to develop a method to quantify the dissimilarity between sample data and prediction locations in geospatial machine learning, and to investigate how this dissimilarity impacts the accuracy of different cross-validation methods.  The hypothesis is that adversarial validation can effectively quantify this dissimilarity, and that the optimal cross-validation method will depend on the degree of dissimilarity.\n\n4. **Summary of Results:** DAV effectively quantifies dissimilarity across a range of values.  The results confirm that RDM-CV is best for low dissimilarity, while geospatial methods (especially SP-CV) are better for high dissimilarity.  No method is consistently accurate across all dissimilarity levels, highlighting the importance of considering dissimilarity when choosing a CV method.\n\n\n**3. GeoCode-GPT: A Large Language Model for Geospatial Code Generation Tasks**\n\n1. **Title:** GeoCode-GPT: A Large Language Model for Geospatial Code Generation Tasks\n\n2. **Abstract:**  The paper introduces GeoCode-GPT-7B, an LLM for geospatial code generation.  It addresses challenges like \"refusal to code\" and hallucinations by creating domain-specific corpora (GeoCode-PT, GeoCode-SFT) and using QLoRA/LoRA for training.  A comprehensive evaluation framework is used, showing GeoCode-GPT outperforms other models in multiple-choice accuracy, code summarization, and code generation.\n\n3. **Main idea and hypothesis:** The main idea is to develop a large language model specifically trained for geospatial code generation to improve efficiency and accuracy compared to general-purpose LLMs. The hypothesis is that training an LLM on a large, domain-specific dataset of geospatial code and instructions will result in significantly improved performance in geospatial code generation tasks.\n\n4. **Summary of Results:** GeoCode-GPT-7B significantly outperforms baseline models (including larger ones) in multiple-choice questions, code summarization, and code generation tasks. While not surpassing GPT-4 in all metrics, it demonstrates substantial improvement over other open-source models, validating the effectiveness of the proposed corpora and training strategy.\n\n\n**4. The Predictive Context Tree: Predicting Contexts and Interactions**\n\n1. **Title:** The Predictive Context Tree: Predicting Contexts and Interactions\n\n2. **Abstract:** This paper presents the Predictive Context Tree (PCT), a hierarchical classifier for predicting future locations and contexts of mobile users using only geospatial trajectories and supplementary data.  The PCT is evaluated and compared to existing location prediction techniques, demonstrating higher predictive accuracy using a hybrid approach and comparable performance to the hybrid approach in predicting future interactions.\n\n3. **Main idea and hypothesis:** The main idea is to develop a model that predicts both the location and context of a user's future activities using only geospatial data augmented with readily available information, overcoming limitations of existing methods that rely on additional sensor data. The hypothesis is that incorporating real-world location information (elements) and a hierarchical prediction model (PCT) will improve the accuracy of location and context prediction compared to traditional methods.\n\n4. **Summary of Results:** The PCT achieves comparable or better predictive accuracy than existing techniques (SVMs and HMMs) for predicting future locations (elements).  The PCT also successfully predicts contexts, providing additional utility beyond simple location prediction.  Using identified land usage elements improves accuracy over using extracted locations, especially for longer interaction durations.  Pruning the context tree reduces computational cost with a trade-off in accuracy.  Multi-element prediction shows that the PCT can effectively predict multiple simultaneous interactions.",
