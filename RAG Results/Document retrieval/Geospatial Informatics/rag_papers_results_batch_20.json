MULTI-SPECTRAL REMOTE SENSING IMAGE RETRIEVAL USING GEOSPATIAL FOUNDATION MODELS**\n\n1. **Title:** MULTI-SPECTRAL REMOTE SENSING IMAGE RETRIEVAL USING GEOSPATIAL FOUNDATION MODELS\n\n2. **Abstract:** Image retrieval enables efficient search through vast amounts of satellite imagery and returns similar images to a query. Deep learning models can identify images across various semantic concepts without the need for annotations. This work proposes to use Geospatial Foundation Models, like Prithvi, for remote sensing image retrieval with multiple benefits: i) the models encode multi-spectral satellite data and ii) generalize without further fine-tuning.  We introduce two datasets to the retrieval task and observe strong performance: Prithvi processes six bands and achieves a mean Average Precision of 97.62% on BigEarthNet-43 and 44.51% on ForestNet-12, outperforming other RGB-based models. Further, we evaluate three compression methods with binarized embeddings balancing retrieval speed and accuracy.\n\n3. **Main idea and hypothesis:** The paper hypothesizes that Geospatial Foundation Models (GeoFMs), pre-trained on large multi-spectral datasets, can effectively and efficiently perform content-based image retrieval (CBIR) in remote sensing, outperforming RGB-only models and offering a good trade-off between accuracy and speed through compression techniques.\n\n4. **Summary of Results:** Prithvi-100M, a GeoFM, significantly outperformed other models (including RGB-only versions) on two multi-spectral datasets (BigEarthNet and ForestNet) in terms of mean Average Precision (mAP).  Binary embeddings achieved comparable accuracy to floating-point embeddings but with a 32-fold compression and significantly faster retrieval times (17ms vs 33ms).  A simple hashing method also showed reasonable performance, although lower than binary embeddings.\n\n\n**2. Non-Stationary Spectral Kernels**\n\n1. **Title:** Non-Stationary Spectral Kernels\n\n2. **Abstract:** We propose non-stationary spectral kernels for Gaussian process regression. We propose to model the spectral density of a non-stationary kernel function as a mixture of input-dependent Gaussian process frequency density surfaces. We solve the generalized Fourier transform with such a model, and present a family of non-stationary and non-monotonic kernels that can learn input-dependent and potentially long-range, non-monotonic covariances between inputs. We derive efficient inference using model whitening and marginalized posterior, and show with case studies that these kernels are necessary when modelling even rather simple time series, image or geospatial data with non-stationary characteristics.\n\n3. **Main idea and hypothesis:** The paper hypothesizes that a new family of non-stationary and non-monotonic kernels, derived from a generalized Fourier transform and modeled as a mixture of input-dependent Gaussian processes, will be more effective than existing stationary or monotonic kernels for modeling data with non-stationary characteristics (e.g., time series, images, geospatial data) exhibiting long-range or periodic correlations.\n\n4. **Summary of Results:** The proposed Generalized Spectral Mixture (GSM) kernel demonstrated superior performance in modeling time series with varying frequencies, texture images (achieving better extrapolation than comparative methods), and land surface temperatures (capturing non-stationary spatial and temporal covariances).  The kernel's flexibility and efficiency were highlighted, showing its ability to handle long-range and periodic relations in an input-dependent manner.  A simpler Bivariate Spectral Mixture kernel was also derived but deemed impractical for large datasets.\n\n\n**3. GeoAggregator: An Efficient Transformer Model for Geo-Spatial Tabular Data**\n\n1. **Title:** GeoAggregator: An Efficient Transformer Model for Geo-Spatial Tabular Data\n\n2. **Abstract:** Modeling geospatial tabular data with deep learning has become a promising alternative to traditional statistical and machine learning approaches. However, existing deep learning models often face challenges related to scalability and flexibility as datasets grow. To this end, this paper introduces GeoAggregator, an efficient and lightweight algorithm based on transformer architecture designed specifically for geospatial tabular data modeling. GeoAggregators explicitly account for spatial autocorrelation and spatial heterogeneity through Gaussian-biased local attention and global positional awareness. Additionally, we introduce a new attention mechanism that uses the Cartesian product to manage the size of the model while maintaining strong expressive power. We benchmark GeoAggregator against spatial statistical models, XGBoost, and several state-of-the-art geospatial deep learning methods using both synthetic and empirical geospatial datasets. The results demonstrate that GeoAggregators achieve the best or second-best performance compared to their competitors on nearly all datasets. GeoAggregator\u2019s efficiency is underscored by its reduced model size, making it both scalable and lightweight. Moreover, ablation experiments offer insights into the effectiveness of the Gaussian bias and Cartesian attention mechanism, providing recommendations for further optimizing the GeoAggregator\u2019s performance.\n\n3. **Main idea and hypothesis:** The paper hypothesizes that a novel transformer-based model, GeoAggregator, incorporating Gaussian-biased local attention and a Cartesian product attention mechanism, will be more efficient and accurate than existing deep learning and traditional methods for modeling geospatial tabular data, especially for large datasets.\n\n4. **Summary of Results:** GeoAggregator consistently achieved top or near-top performance across various synthetic and real-world datasets (PM2.5, Housing, Poverty) compared to baseline models (GWR, XGBoost, SRGCNN, GCNNWR, GSH-EL).  Its efficiency was demonstrated through a smaller model size and linear scaling of computational complexity with input size, making it scalable to large datasets. Ablation studies confirmed the effectiveness of the Gaussian bias and Cartesian attention mechanism.\n\n\n**4. TAACKIT: Track Annotation and Analytics with Continuous Knowledge Integration Tool**\n\n1. **Title:** TAACKIT: Track Annotation and Analytics with Continuous Knowledge Integration Tool\n\n2. **Abstract:** Machine learning (ML) is a powerful tool for efficiently analyzing data, detecting patterns, and forecasting trends across various domains such as text, audio, and images. The availability of annotation tools to generate reliably annotated data is crucial for advances in ML applications. In the domain of geospatial tracks, the lack of such tools to annotate and validate data impedes rapid and accessible ML application development. This paper presents Track Annotation and Analytics with Continuous Knowledge Integration Tool (TAACKIT) to serve the critically important functions of annotating geospatial track data and validating ML models. We demonstrate an ML application use case in the air traffic domain to illustrate its data annotation and model evaluation power and quantify the annotation effort reduction.\n\n3. **Main idea and hypothesis:** The paper hypothesizes that TAACKIT, a new tool integrating annotation and model validation capabilities, will significantly reduce the effort required for developing machine learning applications using geospatial track data.\n\n4. **Summary of Results:** TAACKIT, a web-based tool built on Cesium, successfully addressed the lack of ML-centric geospatial track annotation tools. A use case in air traffic analytics demonstrated its ability to streamline the annotation process by integrating unsupervised (K-means) and supervised (SVM) machine learning. The iterative approach of model training, prediction, and human verification significantly reduced annotation effort (by 77% to 94% in the example), highlighting the efficiency of TAACKIT in generating ML-ready datasets.",
