BAYESIAN UPDATING OF SEISMIC GROUND FAILURE ESTIMATES VIA CAUSAL GRAPHICAL MODELS AND SATELLITE IMAGERY**\n\n1. **Title:** BAYESIAN UPDATING OF SEISMIC GROUND FAILURE ESTIMATES VIA CAUSAL GRAPHICAL MODELS AND SATELLITE IMAGERY\n\n2. **Abstract:** Earthquake-induced secondary ground failure hazards (liquefaction, landslides) cause catastrophic damage.  The USGS provides rapid hazard estimations but these are limited by resolution and uncertainty.  This study develops a causal graph-based Bayesian network to model interdependencies between geospatial features, seismic ground failures, building damage, and Damage Proxy Maps (DPMs from satellite imagery).  A stochastic variational inference algorithm updates posterior probabilities of unobserved landslides, liquefaction, and building damage.\n\n3. **Main Idea and Hypothesis:** The hypothesis is that integrating geospatial models (providing physical insights) with remote sensing observations (providing event-specific surface change patterns) via a causal graph-based Bayesian network will improve the accuracy and resolution of earthquake-induced ground failure and building damage estimations compared to using geospatial models alone.  The complex interdependencies between different hazard types are explicitly modeled to reduce bias and uncertainty.\n\n4. **Summary of Results:** The method was applied to the 2018 Hokkaido Iburi-Tobu and 2020 Southwest Puerto Rico earthquakes. Results showed that incorporating DPMs significantly improved the accuracy and resolution of landslide and liquefaction estimations compared to existing USGS models.  The posterior models identified more true positives and reduced false positives.  The method also estimated building damage distributions, although ground truth data for precise quantitative evaluation was limited.\n\n\n**2. Reachability Embeddings: Scalable Self-Supervised Representation Learning from Spatiotemporal Motion Trajectories for Multimodal Computer Vision**\n\n1. **Title:** Reachability Embeddings: Scalable Self-Supervised Representation Learning from Spatiotemporal Motion Trajectories for Multimodal Computer Vision\n\n2. **Abstract:** (Not fully provided, but implied)  The paper proposes a self-supervised method for learning geographic location representations from GPS trajectories.  These \"reachability embeddings\" preserve spatial proximity and can be used alone or combined with other data modalities for geospatial computer vision tasks.\n\n3. **Main Idea and Hypothesis:** The hypothesis is that learning node embeddings from a graph representation of the Earth's surface, inferred from GPS trajectories, will create semantically meaningful and useful representations of geographic locations that improve the performance of downstream geospatial computer vision tasks.  The method emphasizes scalability and the ability to integrate with other data modalities.\n\n4. **Summary of Results:** Reachability embeddings were used as pixel representations in five semantic segmentation tasks (overpass, crosswalk, access point, traffic light, stop sign detection).  Reachability-based models significantly outperformed baseline models (using Local Aggregate Representations) in terms of AUPRC, showing a 4-23% gain.  The method demonstrated scalability using the T-Drive dataset.\n\n\n**3. Self-supervised Learning for Geospatial AI: A Survey**\n\n1. **Title:** Self-supervised Learning for Geospatial AI: A Survey\n\n2. **Abstract:**  The paper surveys self-supervised learning (SSL) techniques applied to geospatial data (points, polylines, polygons). It categorizes methods, discusses applications, and highlights emerging trends and challenges.\n\n3. **Main Idea and Hypothesis:** The main idea is to systematically review and categorize existing self-supervised learning techniques for various geospatial data types (points, polylines, polygons) and to discuss their applications and limitations in the context of GeoAI.  The underlying hypothesis is that self-supervised learning can effectively leverage the abundance of unlabeled geospatial data to improve the performance and generalizability of GeoAI models.\n\n4. **Summary of Results:** The survey categorizes SSL methods into predictive and contrastive approaches and examines their application to different geospatial data types (points, polylines, polygons), highlighting the specific challenges and opportunities within each category.  It identifies emerging trends like multi-type learning and integration with language models, and discusses limitations and future research directions.\n\n\n**4. Pattern Integration and Enhancement Vision Transformer for Self-supervised Learning in Remote Sensing**\n\n1. **Title:** Pattern Integration and Enhancement Vision Transformer for Self-supervised Learning in Remote Sensing\n\n2. **Abstract:** Existing self-supervised learning methods struggle with scenographic remote sensing images.  This paper introduces PIEViT, a teacher-student Vision Transformer that uses a Geospatial Pattern Cohesion (GPC) module to aggregate similar objects and a Feature Integration Projection (FIP) module to refine masked token reconstruction.\n\n3. **Main Idea and Hypothesis:** The hypothesis is that leveraging the natural clustering of patches in remote sensing images (geospatial pattern cohesion) will improve the performance of self-supervised learning for remote sensing and lead to better generalization to downstream tasks compared to existing methods.\n\n4. **Summary of Results:** PIEViT significantly outperformed existing self-supervised baselines in object detection, land cover classification, and change detection tasks. The GPC and FIP modules were shown to be crucial for improving feature representation and generalization.\n\n\n**5. GFM4MPM: Towards Geospatial Foundation Models for Mineral Prospectivity Mapping**\n\n1. **Title:** GFM4MPM: Towards Geospatial Foundation Models for Mineral Prospectivity Mapping\n\n2. **Abstract:**  Deep learning for Mineral Prospectivity Mapping (MPM) suffers from overfitting due to label scarcity. This paper proposes a self-supervised learning approach using masked image modeling to pretrain a backbone network on unlabeled geospatial data.\n\n3. **Main Idea and Hypothesis:** The hypothesis is that pretraining a deep learning model for MPM using a self-supervised masked image modeling approach on unlabeled geospatial data will improve the robustness and generalization of the model compared to training directly on labeled data alone, leading to better MPM predictions.\n\n4. **Summary of Results:** The self-supervised approach consistently improved prediction performance (F1, MCC, AUPRC, B.ACC) over baselines (WoE, GBM, ANN, CNN, ViT) for MVT and CD Lead-Zinc deposits.  Ablation studies showed robustness to sparse input data.  Explainable AI techniques were used to interpret predictions from a geological perspective.  The authors suggest this is a step towards geospatial foundation models for mineral exploration.",
