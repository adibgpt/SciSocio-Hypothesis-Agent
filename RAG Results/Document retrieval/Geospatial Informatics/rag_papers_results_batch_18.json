        "response": "Here's a summary of the main idea and key results of each paper, based on the provided excerpts:\n\n**Paper 1: MapSAM: Adapting Segment Anything Model for Automated Feature Detection in Historical Maps**\n\n1. **Title:** MapSAM: Adapting Segment Anything Model for Automated Feature Detection in Historical Maps\n\n2. **Abstract:** Automated feature detection in historical maps can significantly accelerate the reconstruction of the geospatial past.  However, this process is often constrained by the time-consuming task of manually digitizing sufficient high-quality training data. The emergence of visual foundation models, such as the Segment Anything Model (SAM), offers a promising solution due to their remarkable generalization capabilities and rapid adaptation to new data distributions.  MapSAM adapts SAM into a prompt-free and versatile solution for various downstream historical map segmentation tasks using parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) and automatic prompting.\n\n3. **Main idea and hypothesis:** The hypothesis is that the Segment Anything Model (SAM), a powerful visual foundation model, can be efficiently adapted for historical map segmentation by addressing its limitations:  the need for manual prompts and its suboptimal performance on certain historical map features.  This adaptation can be achieved through parameter-efficient fine-tuning and automatic prompt generation.\n\n4. **Summary of Results:** MapSAM, using DoRA for fine-tuning, an auto-prompt generator, positional-semantic prompting, and masked attention, outperforms baselines (U-Net, SAMed, Few-Shot SAM) on railway and vineyard detection tasks in historical maps, especially in low-data (few-shot) settings.  It demonstrates the effectiveness of adapting foundation models for historical map segmentation, even with limited training data.\n\n\n**Paper 2: Desk-AId: Humanitarian Aid Desk Assessment with Geospatial AI for Predicting Landmine Areas**\n\n1. **Title:** Desk-AId: Humanitarian Aid Desk Assessment with Geospatial AI for Predicting Landmine Areas\n\n2. **Abstract:** The process of clearing areas (demining) starts by assessing and prioritizing potential hazardous areas (desk assessment). This paper presents Desk-AId, which supports the desk assessment phase by estimating landmine risks using geospatial data and socioeconomic information.  It uses a Geospatial AI approach including mixed data sampling strategies and context-enrichment.\n\n3. **Main idea and hypothesis:** The hypothesis is that combining geospatial data, socioeconomic information, and a novel hard-negative data sampling strategy will improve the accuracy of landmine risk assessment during the desk assessment phase of demining operations.\n\n4. **Summary of Results:** Desk-AId, using a hybrid sampling approach (combining hard-negative and random sampling) and various machine learning models (RandomForest, FNN, GNN), achieves up to 92% accuracy in landmine risk assessment in both country-wide and uncharted study areas in Afghanistan. The GNN model outperforms other models. The system is designed for easy reuse and application to new regions.\n\n\n**Paper 3: Towards Robust Trajectory Representations: Isolating Environmental Confounders with Causal Learning**\n\n1. **Title:** Towards Robust Trajectory Representations: Isolating Environmental Confounders with Causal Learning\n\n2. **Abstract:** Existing trajectory modeling studies often ignore confounding effects of geospatial context.  This paper presents TrajCL, a trajectory modeling framework based on causal learning, which uses backdoor adjustment to eliminate spurious correlations between geospatial context and trajectories.\n\n3. **Main idea and hypothesis:** The hypothesis is that incorporating causal learning techniques into trajectory representation learning will mitigate the confounding effects of geospatial context, leading to more robust and generalizable trajectory representations.\n\n4. **Summary of Results:** TrajCL, using backdoor adjustment through an environmental alignment module and a causal learning module, significantly improves performance on trajectory classification tasks compared to baselines (GRU, BiLSTM, GRU-D, STGN, TrajFormer) and demonstrates superior generalization and interpretability, particularly in few-shot and imbalanced data scenarios.\n\n\n**Paper 4:  Lingbo Liu: Writing \u2013 review & editing, Writing \u2013 original draft, Software, Methodology, Conceptualization.**\n\nThis is not a paper title or abstract, but a CRediT authorship contribution statement.  Therefore, I cannot summarize it as a research paper.\n\n\n**Paper 5: Distribution Shifts at Scale: Out-of-distribution Detection in Earth Observation**\n\n1. **Title:** Distribution Shifts at Scale: Out-of-distribution Detection in Earth Observation\n\n2. **Abstract:** Training robust deep learning models is critical in Earth Observation, where globally deployed models often face distribution shifts that degrade performance.  This paper proposes TARDIS, a post-hoc OOD detection method for scalable geospatial deployments.  The core novelty lies in generating surrogate labels by integrating information from ID data and unknown distributions.\n\n3. **Main idea and hypothesis:** The hypothesis is that out-of-distribution (OOD) samples in Earth Observation data trigger distinct internal activation patterns within a pre-trained model, and that these patterns can be used to build a reliable OOD detector without requiring access to actual OOD data during training.\n\n4. **Summary of Results:** TARDIS, using a clustering-based approach to generate surrogate labels and a binary classifier, achieves near-oracle performance in OOD detection across various controlled distribution shifts (covariate and semantic) on EuroSAT and xBD datasets.  It is demonstrated to be scalable for large-scale deployment on the Fields of the World dataset, providing actionable insights into model behavior and reliability in global applications.",
