Seasonality in Dynamic Stochastic Block Models**\n\n1. **Title:** Seasonality in Dynamic Stochastic Block Models\n\n2. **Abstract:** Sociotechnological and geospatial processes exhibit time-varying structure that makes insight discovery challenging. This paper proposes a new statistical model for such systems, modeled as dynamic networks, to address this challenge. It assumes that vertices fall into one of k types and that the probability of edge formation at a particular time depends on the types of the incident nodes and the current time. The time dependencies are driven by unique seasonal processes, which many systems exhibit (e.g., predictable spikes in geospatial or web traffic each day). The paper defines the model as a generative process and an inference procedure to recover the seasonal processes from data when they are unknown. Evaluation with synthetic dynamic networks shows the recovery of the latent seasonal processes that drive its formation.\n\n3. **Main Idea and Hypothesis:**  Many complex systems exhibit regular, time-dependent, seasonal patterns. The paper hypothesizes that incorporating seasonality into dynamic stochastic block models (DSBMs) will improve their ability to model these systems and accurately recover the underlying seasonal processes driving network formation.\n\n4. **Summary of Results:** A new model, the seasonal DSBM (SDSBM), is proposed and evaluated on synthetic data.  The results demonstrate the model's ability to accurately recover latent seasonal processes driving network formation, with accuracy increasing linearly with the number of observed seasons and decreasing exponentially with increasing observation noise.\n\n\n**2. Quantifying Geospatial in the Common Crawl Corpus**\n\n1. **Title:** Quantifying Geospatial in the Common Crawl Corpus\n\n2. **Abstract:** Large language models (LLMs) exhibit emerging geospatial capabilities, stemming from their pre-training on vast unlabelled text datasets that are often derived from the Common Crawl (CC) corpus. However, the geospatial content within CC remains largely unexplored, impacting our understanding of LLMs\u2019 spatial reasoning. This paper investigates the prevalence of geospatial data in recent Common Crawl releases using Gemini 1.5, a powerful language model. By analyzing a sample of documents and manually revising the results, we estimate that 18.7% of web documents in CC contain geospatial information such as coordinates and addresses. We find little difference in prevalence between English- and non-English-language documents. Our findings provide quantitative insights into the nature and extent of geospatial data in CC, and lay the groundwork for future studies of geospatial biases of LLMs.\n\n3. **Main Idea and Hypothesis:** The paper aims to quantify the prevalence of geospatial data (coordinates and addresses) within the Common Crawl corpus.  The underlying hypothesis is that a significant portion of CC documents contain geospatial information, and this information is relatively evenly distributed across languages.\n\n4. **Summary of Results:** Using Gemini 1.5 and manual verification, the study estimates that 18.7% \u00b1 0.5% of web documents in recent Common Crawl releases contain geospatial information.  The prevalence is relatively consistent across English and non-English documents.  The study highlights the potential of CC as a resource for geospatial data and the need for further research into geospatial biases in LLMs.\n\n\n**3. Comparative Performance of Advanced NLP Models and LLMs in Multilingual Geo-Entity Detection**\n\n1. **Title:** Comparative Performance of Advanced NLP Models and LLMs in Multilingual Geo-Entity Detection\n\n2. **Abstract:** (Not explicitly provided in the excerpt, but implied) The paper evaluates the performance of several advanced NLP models and LLMs in detecting geo-entities from multilingual text data (English, Russian, and Arabic).\n\n3. **Main Idea and Hypothesis:** The paper aims to compare the performance of different NLP models (SpaCy, XLM-RoBERTa, mLUKE, GeoLM) and LLMs (GPT-3.5, GPT-4) in multilingual geo-entity detection. The hypothesis is that LLMs will outperform traditional NLP models, particularly in handling complex linguistic nuances and diverse languages.\n\n4. **Summary of Results:**  The results, presented in a table, show varying performance across models and languages.  XLM-RoBERTa and GPT-4 generally perform well across English and Russian, while SpaCy struggles with Arabic. GeoLM's performance is strong in English but significantly weaker in other languages.  The study highlights the strengths and weaknesses of different approaches and the challenges of multilingual geo-entity detection.\n\n\n**4. Test-time adaptation for geospatial point cloud semantic segmentation with distinct domain shifts**\n\n1. **Title:** Test-time adaptation for geospatial point cloud semantic segmentation with distinct domain shifts\n\n2. **Abstract:** Domain adaptation (DA) techniques aim to close the gap between source and target domains, enabling deep learning models to generalize across different data shift paradigms for point cloud semantic segmentation (PCSS). Among emerging DA schemes, test-time adaptation (TTA) facilitates direct adaptation of a pre-trained model to unlabeled data during the inference stage without access to source domain data and need for additional training process, which mitigates data privacy concerns and removes the requirement for substantial computational power. To fill the gap of leveraging TTA for geospatial PCSS, we introduce three typical domain shift paradigms in handling geospatial point clouds and construct three practical adaptation benchmarks, including photogrammetric point clouds to airborne LiDAR, airborne LiDAR to mobile LiDAR, and synthetic to mobile LiDAR. Then, a TTA method is proposed by exploiting the domain-specific knowledge embedded within the batch normalization (BN) layers. Given the pre-trained model, BN statistical information is progressively updated by fusing the statistics of each testing batch. Furthermore, we develop a self-supervised module to optimize the learnable BN affine parameters. Information maximization is used to generate confident and category-specific predictions, and reliability constrained pseudo-labeling is further incorporated to create supervisory signals. Extensive experimental analysis demonstrates that our proposed method significantly improves classification accuracy compared to directly applying the inference by up to 20% in terms of mIoU, which not only outperforms other popular counterparts but also maintains a high efficiency while avoiding retraining. In an adaptation of photogrammetric (SensatUrban) to airborne (Hessigheim 3D), our method achieves a mIoU of 59.46% and an OA of 85. 97%.\n\n3. **Main Idea and Hypothesis:** The paper proposes a test-time adaptation (TTA) method for point cloud semantic segmentation to handle domain shifts between different types of geospatial point cloud data (photogrammetry, airborne LiDAR, mobile LiDAR, synthetic). The hypothesis is that leveraging batch normalization (BN) layer statistics and a self-supervised learning approach during inference will improve the accuracy of the model on the target domain without requiring retraining.\n\n4. **Summary of Results:** The proposed TTA method, which uses progressive batch normalization and a self-supervised learning module, significantly improves the accuracy (mIoU and OA) of point cloud semantic segmentation across three different domain adaptation scenarios compared to baseline methods.  The method outperforms existing TTA techniques and maintains high efficiency.\n\n\n**5. Geospatial Disparities: A Case Study on Real Estate Prices in Paris**\n\n1. **Title:** Geospatial Disparities: A Case Study on Real Estate Prices in Paris\n\n2. **Abstract:** Driven by an increasing prevalence of trackers, ever more IoT sensors, and the declining cost of computing power, geospatial information has come to play a pivotal role in contemporary predictive models. While enhancing prognostic performance, geospatial data also has the potential to perpetuate many historical socio-economic patterns, raising concerns about a resurgence of biases and exclusionary practices, with their disproportionate impacts on society. Addressing this, our paper emphasizes the crucial need to identify and rectify such biases and calibration errors in predictive models, particularly as algorithms become more intricate and less interpretable. The increasing granularity of geospatial information further introduces ethical concerns, as choosing different geographical scales may exacerbate disparities akin to redlining and exclusionary zoning. To address these issues, we propose a toolkit for identifying and mitigating biases arising from geospatial data. Extending classical fairness definitions, we incorporate an ordinal regression case with spatial attributes, deviating from the binary classification focus. This extension allows us to gauge disparities stemming from data aggregation levels and advocates for a less interfering correction approach. Illustrating our methodology using a Parisian real estate dataset, we showcase practical applications and scrutinize the implications of choosing geographical aggregation levels for fairness and calibration measures.\n\n3. **Main Idea and Hypothesis:** The paper investigates how the choice of geographic aggregation level affects model calibration and fairness in the context of real estate price prediction. The hypothesis is that different aggregation levels will reveal varying degrees of calibration error and unfairness, highlighting the importance of careful consideration of spatial scale in model evaluation and mitigation.\n\n4. **Summary of Results:** Using Parisian real estate data, the study shows that even a globally well-calibrated model can exhibit significant disparities in calibration and fairness across different geographic regions (arrondissements and IRIS).  The level of spatial aggregation significantly impacts the measured fairness and calibration.  A post-processing method is proposed to mitigate fairness issues while minimizing the impact on predictive accuracy.  The study emphasizes the need for careful consideration of spatial scale in evaluating and mitigating biases in geospatial predictive models.",
