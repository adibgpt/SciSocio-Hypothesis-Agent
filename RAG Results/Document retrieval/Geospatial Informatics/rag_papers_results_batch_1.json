Specifically, we first propose a three-step network that explicitly employs depth completion for visibility prediction. Then the visibility information of multiple views is aggregated to generate a 3D mesh model by solving an optimization problem considering visibility in which a novel adaptive visibility weighting in surface determination is also introduced to suppress line of sight with a large incident angle. Compared to other learning-based approaches, our pipeline only exercises the learning on a 2D binary classification task, i.e., points visible or not in a view, which is much more generalizable and practically more efficient and capable to deal with a large number of points. Experiments demonstrate that our method with\n\n3. **Main Idea and Hypothesis:** The hypothesis is that combining a learned virtual view visibility with a traditional graph-cut based mesh generation method will lead to more efficient and accurate mesh reconstruction from unstructured point clouds, especially for large-scale scenes.  The paper argues that focusing the deep learning component on the simpler task of visibility prediction (a 2D binary classification problem) improves generalization and efficiency compared to complex end-to-end learning approaches.\n\n4. **Summary of Results:** The proposed Vis2Mesh framework, which uses a three-step neural network for visibility prediction and an adaptive visibility weighting scheme for graph-cut surface reconstruction, outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods on datasets of varying scales.  The method demonstrates better generalization capabilities across different scene types and is efficient even when dealing with millions of points.  Ablation studies confirm the importance of both virtual view visibility and the adaptive weighting scheme.\n\n\n**Paper 2**\n\n1. **Title:** Mesh Conflation of Oblique Photogrammetric Models Using Virtual Cameras and Truncated Signed Distance Field\n\n2. **Abstract:** Conflating/stitching 2.5D raster digital surface models (DSM) into a large one has been a running practice in geoscience applications, however, conflating full-3D mesh models, such as those from oblique photogrammetry, is extremely challenging. In this letter, we propose a novel approach to address this challenge by conflating multiple full-3D oblique photogrammetric models into a single, and seamless mesh for high-resolution site modeling. Given two or more individually collected and created photogrammetric meshes, we first propose to create a virtual camera field (with a panoramic field of view) to incubate virtual spaces represented by Truncated Signed Distance Field (TSDF), an implicit volumetric field friendly for linear 3D fusion; then we adaptively leverage the truncated bound of meshes in TSDF to conflate them into a single and accurate full 3D site model. With drone-based 3D meshes, we show that our approach significantly improves upon traditional methods for model conflations, to drive new potentials to create excessively large and accurate full 3D mesh models in support of geoscience and environmental applications.\n\n3. **Main Idea and Hypothesis:** The hypothesis is that using a virtual camera-based TSDF approach will provide a more effective and efficient way to conflate multiple full 3D oblique photogrammetric models compared to traditional methods.  The use of a panoramic virtual camera field aims to reduce occlusion issues, while the TSDF representation allows for a more robust fusion of the meshes.\n\n4. **Summary of Results:** The proposed method significantly improves the accuracy and integrity of conflated 3D site models compared to traditional techniques.  The use of virtual cameras and TSDF enables seamless handling of complex topologies and manifold geometries, which are challenging for traditional Boolean operations.  Quantitative results demonstrate improved accuracy compared to a reference mesh.\n\n\n**Paper 3**\n\n1. **Title:** A General Albedo Recovery Approach for Aerial Photogrammetric Images through Inverse Rendering\n\n2. **Abstract:** (Not fully provided, but inferred from the excerpt)  The paper proposes a physics-based approach for recovering albedo from aerial photogrammetric images using inverse rendering.  It leverages metadata from the photogrammetric data collection (e.g., solar position, camera parameters) to build a sophisticated lighting model and accurately estimate albedo.\n\n3. **Main Idea and Hypothesis:** The hypothesis is that by accurately modeling outdoor lighting conditions using photogrammetric metadata, a more accurate and robust albedo recovery can be achieved compared to existing methods.  This improved albedo estimation will then improve the realism of rendered models and enhance various photogrammetric processing steps.\n\n4. **Summary of Results:** The proposed method shows significant improvements in albedo recovery compared to existing techniques, both quantitatively (higher PSNR, SSIM, lower MAE) and qualitatively. The improved albedo estimates lead to more realistic relighting of 3D models, better feature extraction and matching, improved dense matching results, and enhanced change detection capabilities in ultra-high-resolution images.  The method demonstrates multi-temporal consistency, showing that albedo estimations from images taken at different times of the day are more consistent than the original images.\n\n\n**Paper 4**\n\n1. **Title:** SatSwinMAE: Efficient Autoencoding for Multiscale Time-series Satellite Imagery\n\n2. **Abstract:** Recent advancements in foundation models have significantly impacted various fields, including natural language processing, computer vision, and multi-modal tasks. One area that stands to benefit greatly is Earth observation, where these models can efficiently process large-scale, unlabeled geospatial data. In this work we extend the SwinMAE model to integrate temporal information for satellite time-series data. The architecture employs a hierarchical 3D Masked Autoencoder (MAE) with Video Swin Transformer blocks to effectively capture multi-scale spatio-temporal dependencies in satellite imagery. To enhance transfer learning, we incorporate both encoder and decoder pretrained weigths, along with skip connections to preserve scale-specific information. This forms an architecture similar to SwinUNet with an additional temporal component. Our approach shows significant performance improvements over existing state-of-the-art foundation models for all the evaluated downstream tasks: land cover segmentation, building density prediction, flood mapping, wildfire scar mapping and multi-temporal crop segmentation. Particularly, in the land cover segmentation task of the PhilEO Bench dataset, it outpeforms other geospatial foundation models with a 10.4% higher accuracy.\n\n3. **Main Idea and Hypothesis:** The hypothesis is that extending the SwinMAE architecture to handle temporal information in satellite time-series data, using a 3D masked autoencoder with Video Swin Transformer blocks and skip connections, will lead to a more effective foundation model for various geospatial tasks.  The hierarchical nature of the Swin Transformer is expected to improve efficiency and handle high-resolution data better than previous ViT-based approaches.\n\n4. **Summary of Results:** The proposed SatSwinMAE model outperforms existing state-of-the-art foundation models on five downstream geospatial tasks: land cover segmentation, building density prediction, flood mapping, wildfire scar mapping, and multi-temporal crop segmentation.  The model shows significant improvements in accuracy, particularly in land cover segmentation on the PhilEO Bench dataset (10.4% higher accuracy).  The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the 3D MAE approach and the benefits of using the Swin Transformer architecture for handling multi-scale spatio-temporal data in Earth observation.\n\n**Paper 5**\n\n1. **Title:** VAE-Info-cGAN: Generating Synthetic Images by Combining Pixel-level and Feature-level Geospatial Conditional Inputs\n\n2. **Abstract:** Training robust supervised deep learning models for many geospatial applications of computer vision is difficult due to dearth of class-balanced and diverse training data. Conversely, obtaining enough training data for many applications is financially prohibitive or may be infeasible, especially when the application involves modeling rare or extreme events. Synthetically generating data (and labels) using a generative model that can sample from a target distribution and exploit the multi-scale nature of images can be an inexpensive solution to address scarcity of labeled data. Towards this goal, we present a deep conditional generative model, called VAE-Info-cGAN, that combines a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) with a conditional Information Maximizing Generative Adversarial Network (InfoGAN), for synthesizing semantically rich images simultaneously conditioned on a pixel-level condition (PLC) and a macroscopic feature-level condition (FLC). Dimensionally, the PLC can only vary in the channel dimension from the synthesized image and is meant to be a task-specific input. The FLC is modeled as an attribute vector, \ud835\udc82, in the latent space of the generated image which controls the contributions of various characteristic attributes germane to the target distribution. During generation, \ud835\udc82 is sampled from U[0, 1], while it is learned directly from the ground truth during training. An interpretation of \ud835\udc82 to systematically generate synthetic images by varying a chosen binary macroscopic feature is explored by training a linear binary classifier in the latent space. Experiments on a GPS trajectories dataset show that the proposed model can accurately generate various forms of spatio-temporal aggregates across different geographic locations while conditioned only on a raster representation of the road network. The primary intended application of the VAE-Info-cGAN is synthetic data (and label) generation for targeted data augmentation for computer vision-based modeling of problems relevant to geospatial analysis and remote sensing.\n\n3. **Main Idea and Hypothesis:** The hypothesis is that a conditional generative model combining both pixel-level (PLC) and feature-level (FLC) conditions will generate higher-quality synthetic images for geospatial applications, addressing the scarcity of labeled data for training supervised deep learning models. The model leverages the strengths of both VAEs and GANs to achieve this.\n\n4. **Summary of Results:** The VAE-Info-cGAN outperforms cVAE and cGAN models in generating synthetic images of GPS trajectories, as measured by APND (Average Pixel-wise Normalized Difference).  The model effectively uses both PLC (road network) and FLC (attributes like time duration) to generate realistic and diverse samples.  An ablation study shows the importance of the discriminator in improving the quality of generated samples. A method for systematically manipulating the latent space to control specific macroscopic features (e.g., time duration) is also demonstrated.",
