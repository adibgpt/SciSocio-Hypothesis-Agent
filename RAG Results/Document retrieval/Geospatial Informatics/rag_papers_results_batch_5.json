Note that abstracts are not always fully present in the provided text.\n\n\n**Paper 1: Large Language Models are Geographically Biased**\n\n1. **Title:** Large Language Models are Geographically Biased\n\n2. **Abstract:** Large Language Models (LLMs) inherently carry biases from their training data, potentially causing societal harm.  This paper investigates geographic bias in LLMs, defined as systemic errors in geospatial predictions.\n\n3. **Main idea and hypothesis:** The main idea is to evaluate the geographic knowledge and biases of LLMs by prompting them to rate locations worldwide on various topics (both objective and subjective). The hypothesis is that LLMs will exhibit biases, particularly against locations with lower socioeconomic conditions, reflecting biases in their training data.\n\n4. **Summary of Results:** LLMs demonstrate surprisingly accurate zero-shot geospatial prediction capabilities, showing strong correlation with ground truth for objective topics.  However, significant biases were found, especially on sensitive subjective topics.  LLMs consistently rate locations with lower socioeconomic conditions (e.g., much of Africa) negatively across various attributes (likability, attractiveness, morality, intelligence, work ethic).  A novel bias score quantifies this, revealing substantial variation in bias levels across different LLMs.  GPT-4 Turbo shows comparatively less bias than other models.\n\n\n**Paper 2: Human-Centered Autonomy for UAS Target Search**\n\n1. **Title:** Human-Centered Autonomy for UAS Target Search\n\n2. **Abstract:** Current UAS deployment methods in dynamic environments require near-constant human supervision. This paper presents a human-centered autonomous framework that infers geospatial mission context to guide a probabilistic target search planner.\n\n3. **Main idea and hypothesis:** The paper aims to improve UAS search and rescue efficiency by incorporating operator expertise into autonomous planning. The hypothesis is that fusing diverse operator inputs (priorities, spatial semantic information, waypoints) with geographic data will lead to more effective search strategies than current methods.\n\n4. **Summary of Results:**  The proposed framework effectively integrates operator preferences into a POMDP-based planner. Simulations using input from professional rescuers show improved task mental model alignment, a significant increase (18%) in victim finds, and substantially more efficient guidance plans (15 times) compared to existing operational methods.\n\n\n**Paper 3: MAPQATOR : A System for Efficient Annotation of Map Query Datasets**\n\n1. **Title:** MAPQATOR : A System for Efficient Annotation of Map Query Datasets\n\n2. **Abstract:** Creating reliable geospatial question-answering (QA) datasets for evaluating LLMs is challenging. MAPQATOR is a web application designed to streamline this process by integrating with various map APIs.\n\n3. **Main idea and hypothesis:** The main idea is to develop a user-friendly tool for creating reproducible and traceable map-based QA datasets. The hypothesis is that this tool will significantly speed up the annotation process compared to manual methods.\n\n4. **Summary of Results:** MAPQATOR offers a plug-and-play architecture for integrating with different map APIs, caching API responses for consistency, and providing visualization tools.  Evaluation shows that MAPQATOR accelerates the annotation process by at least 30 times compared to manual methods.\n\n\n**Paper 4: PAIRS AutoGeo: an Automated Machine Learning Framework for Massive Geospatial Data**\n\n1. **Title:** PAIRS AutoGeo: an Automated Machine Learning Framework for Massive Geospatial Data\n\n2. **Abstract:** Developing machine learning models for geospatial data is complex. PAIRS AutoGeo automates many steps, requiring minimal user input (GPS locations and labels).\n\n3. **Main idea and hypothesis:** The main idea is to create an automated machine learning framework for geospatial data that simplifies the process for non-experts.  The hypothesis is that this automation will enable faster and more efficient development of geospatial ML solutions.\n\n4. **Summary of Results:** PAIRS AutoGeo automates data gathering, quality control, model training, and testing.  A case study on tree species classification using NAIP imagery demonstrates its effectiveness, achieving 59.8% accuracy with a random forest and 81.4% with a modified ResNet model. The framework significantly reduces the technical expertise needed for geospatial ML.\n\n\n**Paper 5: Pretraining Billion-scale Geospatial Foundational Models on Frontier**\n\n1. **Title:** Pretraining Billion-scale Geospatial Foundational Models on Frontier\n\n2. **Abstract:**  This paper explores pretraining billion-scale Foundation Models (FMs) for geospatial applications using the Frontier supercomputer.  The study investigates various model and data-parallel approaches using PyTorch's FSDP.\n\n3. **Main idea and hypothesis:** The main idea is to demonstrate the feasibility and benefits of training very large vision transformer (ViT) models for geospatial tasks on an exascale supercomputer. The hypothesis is that larger models will achieve better performance on downstream tasks.\n\n4. **Summary of Results:** The study details performance experiments on the Frontier supercomputer, outlining different FSDP sharding strategies for ViT models up to 15B parameters.  The largest model (3B parameters) achieves up to 30% improvement in top-1 scene classification accuracy compared to a smaller (100M parameter) model.  The research provides insights into efficient training strategies for large geospatial FMs on HPC systems.",
