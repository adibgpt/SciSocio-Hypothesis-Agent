Note that some information, such as a full abstract, is not available for all papers in the provided excerpts.\n\n**Paper 1: Geospatial Narratives and their Spatio-Temporal Dynamics**\n\n1. **Title:** Geospatial Narratives and their Spatio-Temporal Dynamics: Commonsense Reasoning for High-level Analyses in Geographic Information Systems\n\n2. **Abstract:** The modelling, analysis, and visualisation of dynamic geospatial phenomena has been identified as a key developmental challenge for next-generation Geographic Information Systems (GIS).  This paper presents a conceptual overview and architecture for developing high-level semantic and qualitative analytical capabilities for dynamic geospatial domains.  It addresses challenges involving qualitative abstraction, data integration and spatial consistency, and practical geospatial abduction.\n\n3. **Main Idea and Hypothesis:** The main idea is to integrate formal methods from commonsense reasoning, qualitative reasoning, and computational models of narrative into GIS to enable high-level analysis of dynamic geospatial phenomena. The hypothesis is that a narrative-centered approach, using qualitative spatial and temporal reasoning, can provide a more effective and human-understandable way to analyze and interpret complex geospatial changes.\n\n4. **Summary of Results:** The paper presents a framework for narrative-centered high-level modeling and explanatory analysis in the geospatial domain. It demonstrates how qualitative abstraction, data integration, spatial consistency checks, and geospatial abduction can be used to generate explanations of geospatial dynamics. The authors propose a transdisciplinary approach bringing together Geography, Artificial Intelligence, and Cognitive Science for the development of next-generation GIS.\n\n\n**Paper 2: Large-scale Urban Facility Location Selection with Knowledge-informed Reinforcement Learning**\n\n1. **Title:** Large-scale Urban Facility Location Selection with Knowledge-informed Reinforcement Learning\n\n2. **Abstract:** This paper proposes a reinforcement learning method to solve large-scale urban facility location problems (FLP), capable of producing near-optimal solutions at superfast inference speed.  It uses a knowledge-informed graph neural network to guide edge selections on a graph of urban regions, thus avoiding heavy computation of local search.\n\n3. **Main Idea and Hypothesis:** The main idea is to leverage reinforcement learning and graph neural networks to efficiently solve large-scale urban facility location problems, achieving comparable accuracy to traditional methods but with significantly faster computation. The hypothesis is that a knowledge-informed reinforcement learning approach can effectively learn optimal facility placements in large urban areas, outperforming traditional optimization techniques in terms of speed while maintaining solution quality.\n\n4. **Summary of Results:** Experiments on four US cities showed that the proposed approach achieves comparable performance to commercial solvers with less than 5% accessibility loss, while displaying up to 1000 times speedup.  The method effectively handles multi-facility location problems (MFLP) with multiple facility types and incompatibility constraints.\n\n\n**Paper 3: SeMAnD: Self-Supervised Anomaly Detection in Multimodal Geospatial Datasets**\n\n1. **Title:** SeMAnD: Self-Supervised Anomaly Detection in Multimodal Geospatial Datasets\n\n2. **Abstract:** This paper proposes SeMAnD, a self-supervised anomaly detection technique for geometric anomalies in multimodal geospatial datasets. It uses a data augmentation strategy (RandPolyAugment) and a self-supervised training objective to learn representations discriminative to local changes in one modality not corroborated by others.\n\n3. **Main Idea and Hypothesis:** The main idea is to leverage self-supervised learning and multimodal data fusion to detect geometric anomalies in geospatial datasets. The hypothesis is that by learning representations that are discriminative to augmentations generated by RandPolyAugment, SeMAnD can effectively detect real-world geometric anomalies in geospatial data, outperforming existing domain-agnostic methods.\n\n4. **Summary of Results:** SeMAnD outperforms baseline approaches by 4.8\u201319.7% AUC on real-world geometric anomalies across three diverse geographic regions.  Performance improves with more data modalities and more diverse augmentations.  RandPolyAugment, a domain-specific augmentation strategy, is shown to generalize better for geospatial anomalies than CutPaste.  GradCAM is used effectively for anomaly localization.  SeMAnD is also proposed as a solution for data health monitoring.",
