Bridging Remote Sensors with Multisensor Geospatial Foundation Models**\n\n1. **Title:** Bridging Remote Sensors with Multisensor Geospatial Foundation Models\n\n2. **Abstract:** In the realm of geospatial analysis, the diversity of remote sensors, encompassing both optical and microwave technologies, offers a wealth of distinct observational capabilities. Recognizing this, we present msGFM, a multisensor geospatial foundation model that effectively unifies data from four key sensor modalities. This integration spans an expansive dataset of two million multisensor images. msGFM is uniquely adept at handling both paired and unpaired sensor data.  msGFM, incorporating four remote sensors, upholds strong performance, forming a comprehensive model adaptable to various sensor types. msGFM has demonstrated enhanced proficiency in a range of both single-sensor and multisensor downstream tasks.\n\n3. **Main idea and hypothesis:** The main idea is to create a multi-sensor geospatial foundation model (msGFM) that can effectively integrate data from different remote sensing modalities (optical and microwave), handling both paired and unpaired data, and outperform models trained on single modalities. The hypothesis is that a multi-sensor approach will lead to better performance on various downstream geospatial tasks compared to single-sensor models, and that leveraging pre-trained models from the natural image domain may not be optimal for geospatial data.\n\n4. **Summary of Results:** msGFM, trained on 2 million images from four sensor modalities (RGB, Sentinel-2, SAR, and DSM), showed strong performance across scene classification, segmentation, cloud removal, and pan-sharpening tasks.  The results highlight the benefits of multi-sensor pretraining over single-sensor approaches and demonstrate that representations learned from natural images are not always suitable for geospatial data.  The model effectively handles both paired and unpaired sensor data.\n\n\n**2. Mapping Access to Water and Sanitation in Colombia using Publicly Accessible Satellite Imagery, Crowd-sourced Geospatial Information and Random Forests**\n\n1. **Title:** Mapping Access to Water and Sanitation in Colombia using Publicly Accessible Satellite Imagery, Crowd-sourced Geospatial Information and Random Forests\n\n2. **Abstract:** Up-to-date, granular, and reliable quality of life data is crucial for humanitarian organizations to develop targeted interventions for vulnerable communities, especially in times of crisis.  This paper presents a scalable and inexpensive end-to-end WASH estimation workflow using machine learning and census data, publicly available satellite images, and crowd-sourced geospatial information.  A map of WASH estimates at a granularity of 250m x 250m across Colombia is generated. The model explained up to 65% of the variation in predicting access to water supply, sewage, and toilets.\n\n3. **Main idea and hypothesis:** The main idea is to develop a cost-effective method for mapping access to water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) in Colombia using readily available data sources (satellite imagery, OpenStreetMap data, census data) and machine learning (Random Forests). The hypothesis is that combining these data sources with a Random Forest model can accurately predict WASH access at a finer granularity than traditional methods.\n\n4. **Summary of Results:** The model generated a high-resolution (250m x 250m) WASH access map for all of Colombia.  The model achieved R-squared values of 0.5967, 0.6474, and 0.5357 for predicting access to water supply, sewage, and toilets, respectively.  The authors acknowledge limitations due to data aggregation differences between urban and rural areas and suggest improvements by increasing the temporal coverage of the data and aligning the granularity of labels and features.\n\n\n**3. Normalization of Different Swedish Dialects Spoken in Finland**\n\n1. **Title:** Normalization of Different Swedish Dialects Spoken in Finland\n\n2. **Abstract:** This study presents a dialect normalization method for different Finland Swedish dialects covering six regions. We tested 5 different models, and the best model improved the word error rate from 76.45 to 28.58. Contrary to results reported in earlier research on Finnish dialects, we found that training the model with one word at a time gave best results.  Our models are accessible as a Python package.\n\n3. **Main idea and hypothesis:** The main idea is to develop a method for normalizing Finland Swedish dialects into standard written Swedish using character-level neural machine translation (NMT).  The hypothesis is that NMT can effectively normalize the dialects, and that the optimal input chunk size for the model might differ from previous findings in other languages due to data size differences.\n\n4. **Summary of Results:** Five different NMT models were trained, varying the input chunk size (from one to five words).  The model trained on one word at a time achieved the best performance, reducing the word error rate (WER) from 76.45% to 28.58%. This contrasts with previous research on Finnish dialects, which found that larger chunk sizes were optimal. The authors attribute this to the smaller size of their training dataset. The models are publicly available.\n\n\n**4. A Geospatial Approach to Predicting Desert Locust Breeding Grounds in Africa**\n\n1. **Title:** A Geospatial Approach to Predicting Desert Locust Breeding Grounds in Africa\n\n2. **Abstract:** Desert locust swarms present a major threat to agriculture and food security. This study develops an operationally-ready model for predicting locust breeding grounds using UN-FAO locust observation records and spatio-temporal input features (remotely-sensed environmental and climate data, multi-spectral earth observation images). Custom deep learning models (3D CNN, ConvLSTM) and the Prithvi geospatial foundational model were used. The Prithvi-based model, fine-tuned on multi-spectral images from NASA\u2019s HLS dataset, achieved the highest accuracy, F1, and ROC-AUC scores (83.03%, 81.53%, and 87.69%, respectively). Multi-spectral earth observation images alone were sufficient for effective prediction.\n\n3. **Main idea and hypothesis:** The main idea is to create a highly accurate and operationally ready model for predicting desert locust breeding grounds using machine learning and geospatial data. The hypothesis is that combining remotely sensed environmental data and multi-spectral earth observation images will improve the accuracy of locust breeding ground prediction compared to existing methods, and that multi-spectral images alone might be sufficient for accurate prediction.\n\n4. **Summary of Results:** Several deep learning models (PLAN-LB, Conv3D, ConvLSTM) and classical machine learning models (SVM, Logistic Regression) were trained. The Prithvi-LB model, fine-tuned on multi-spectral HLS imagery, significantly outperformed other models, achieving an accuracy of 83.03%, F1-score of 81.53%, and ROC-AUC score of 87.69%.  A key finding is that multi-spectral images alone provide sufficient information for effective prediction, outperforming models that also used remotely sensed environmental data.\n\n\n**5. Reachability Embeddings: Scalable Self-Supervised Representation Learning from Mobility Trajectories for Multimodal Geospatial Computer Vision**\n\n1. **Title:** Reachability Embeddings: Scalable Self-Supervised Representation Learning from Mobility Trajectories for Multimodal Geospatial Computer Vision\n\n2. **Abstract:** This paper proposes a self-supervised method for learning representations of geographic locations from unlabeled GPS trajectories. Tiles are modeled as nodes on a graph, and GPS trajectories as Markovian paths. A scalable algorithm computes image-like representations (reachability summaries) of spatial connectivity. A convolutional, contractive autoencoder learns compressed representations (reachability embeddings).  Using reachability embeddings as pixel representations for five geospatial tasks (semantic segmentation), the method demonstrates a 4\u201323% gain in AUPRC compared to baselines.\n\n3. **Main idea and hypothesis:** The main idea is to develop a self-supervised method for learning representations of geographic locations from GPS trajectories by modeling them as Markovian paths on a graph.  The hypothesis is that these learned representations (reachability embeddings) will be semantically meaningful and improve the performance of downstream geospatial computer vision tasks compared to methods that don't explicitly model spatial connectivity.\n\n4. **Summary of Results:**  The proposed method generates reachability embeddings, which capture spatial connectivity patterns from GPS trajectories.  A scalable, distributed algorithm is presented.  Experiments on five geospatial tasks showed a 4\u201323% AUPRC improvement over baselines using the learned embeddings.  The embeddings are shown to be effective for multimodal modeling, combining mobility data with other imagery data.",
