Geo-FuB: A Method for Constructing an Operator-Function Knowledge Base for Geospatial Code Generation Tasks Using Large Language Models**\n\n1. **Title:** Geo-FuB: A Method for Constructing an Operator-Function Knowledge Base for Geospatial Code Generation Tasks Using Large Language Models\n\n2. **Abstract:** Large Language Models (LLMs) struggle with geospatial code generation due to a lack of domain-specific knowledge.  Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with an external knowledge base offers a solution, but a framework for building such a base is missing. This study proposes Geo-FuB, a framework with three components (Geo-FuSE, Geo-FuST, Geo-FuM) to build this knowledge base from geospatial scripts.\n\n3. **Main idea and hypothesis:** LLMs can be improved for geospatial code generation by providing them with a domain-specific knowledge base built from existing geospatial scripts.  The hypothesis is that systematically mining semantic and structural knowledge from these scripts and organizing it effectively will significantly reduce coding errors (\"hallucinations\") in LLM-generated geospatial code.\n\n4. **Summary of Results:** Geo-FuB, built from 154,075 Google Earth Engine scripts, achieved an overall accuracy of 88.89% in mapping operator combinations to functions (structural accuracy: 92.03%; semantic accuracy: 86.79%).  The knowledge base is publicly available and applicable to other geospatial platforms. The study demonstrates Geo-FuB's potential in optimizing geospatial code generation using RAG and fine-tuning paradigms.\n\n\n**2. Intrinsic Non-stationary Covariance Function for Climate Modeling**\n\n1. **Title:** Intrinsic Non-stationary Covariance Function for Climate Modeling\n\n2. **Abstract:**  Global-scale geospatial datasets often exhibit non-stationarity and non-uniformly smooth spatial boundaries, posing challenges for covariance function design in climate modeling. This paper proposes a generalized non-stationary covariance function, termed the \"intrinsic non-stationary covariance function,\" which uses intrinsic statistics of symmetric positive definite matrices to represent the characteristic length scale and model local stochastic processes.\n\n3. **Main idea and hypothesis:**  Existing non-stationary covariance functions are inadequate for modeling complex, global-scale climate data due to their inability to handle non-stationarity and non-uniform boundaries effectively. The hypothesis is that incorporating intrinsic statistics on the characteristic length scale (CLS) will lead to a more accurate representation of the underlying spatial correlation in such datasets.\n\n4. **Summary of Results:** Experiments on synthetic and real relative sea level change datasets demonstrated improvements in error metrics for regression estimates using the proposed intrinsic non-stationary covariance function compared to existing methods.  The approach effectively addresses the challenges posed by non-stationarity and non-uniform boundaries in global-scale climate data.\n\n\n**3. Geospatial Big Data: Survey and Challenges**\n\n1. **Title:** Geospatial Big Data: Survey and Challenges\n\n2. **Abstract:** This paper reviews the evolution of geospatial big data (GBD) mining and its integration with AI techniques.  It categorizes geospatial data, outlines the GBD mining process within a unified framework, and explores the potential of LLMs, the Metaverse, and knowledge graphs.  Challenges such as data retrieval and security are also discussed.\n\n3. **Main idea and hypothesis:**  The increasing volume and complexity of geospatial big data necessitate a unified framework for its effective mining, leveraging advanced AI techniques and emerging technologies to address challenges in data management and analysis.  The implicit hypothesis is that a holistic approach integrating various stages of data processing, coupled with novel technologies, will lead to more efficient and insightful analysis of GBD.\n\n4. **Summary of Results:** The paper provides a comprehensive overview of GBD, its sources, and mining techniques. It proposes a unified framework integrating data collection, processing, storage, retrieval, analysis, prediction, and visualization.  The potential of LLMs, the Metaverse, and knowledge graphs for enhancing GBD mining is highlighted, alongside challenges related to data retrieval, security, and privacy.\n\n\n**4. A Uni\ufb01ed Model for Near and Remote Sensing**\n\n1. **Title:** A Uni\ufb01ed Model for Near and Remote Sensing\n\n2. **Abstract:** This paper proposes a convolutional neural network architecture that combines overhead and ground-level images to estimate geospatial functions (e.g., population density, land use). The network uses kernel regression and density estimation to convert ground-level image features into a dense feature map, which is then fused with overhead image features.\n\n3. **Main idea and hypothesis:** Combining overhead and ground-level imagery within a unified deep learning model will improve the accuracy and resolution of geospatial function estimation compared to using either type of imagery alone.  The hypothesis is that the complementary information provided by both perspectives will lead to a more robust and accurate model.\n\n4. **Summary of Results:**  Experiments on a large dataset of overhead and ground-level images from New York City (Brooklyn and Queens) showed that the proposed unified model outperformed baseline methods (using only overhead or ground-level imagery) for estimating building age, building function, and land use.  The use of a spatially varying kernel further improved accuracy.\n\n\n**5. Data-Centric Machine Learning for Earth Observation: Necessary and Sufficient Features**\n\n1. **Title:** Data-Centric Machine Learning for Earth Observation: Necessary and Sufficient Features\n\n2. **Abstract:** This paper explores a data-centric approach to improve machine learning models for Earth Observation by identifying necessary and sufficient features using explainable AI (XAI) techniques.  An incremental deletion approach, iteratively removing less important features, is used to optimize data usage efficiency and model generalization.\n\n3. **Main idea and hypothesis:**  Model explanation methods can be used to identify a minimal set of features sufficient to achieve optimal performance in Earth Observation models, leading to improved efficiency and generalization. The hypothesis is that removing less important features, as identified by XAI methods, will not significantly reduce model accuracy while improving its efficiency and robustness.\n\n4. **Summary of Results:**  Experiments on three temporal multimodal geospatial datasets (CropHarvest, CropYield, China PM2.5) showed that some datasets can achieve optimal accuracy with a small fraction of the temporal instances (less than 20%). In certain cases, a single band from a single modality was sufficient.  The study highlights the potential of data-centric approaches for improving the efficiency and generalizability of Earth Observation models.",
