Transforming Geospatial Ontologies by Homomorphisms**\n\n1. **Title:** Transforming Geospatial Ontologies by Homomorphisms\n\n2. **Abstract:** In this paper, we study the geospatial ontologies that we are interested in together as a geospatial ontology system, consisting of a set of the geospatial ontologies and a set of geospatial ontology operations, without any internal details of the geospatial ontologies and their operations being needed, algebraically.  Each geospatial ontology system homomorphism can be factored as a surjective clustering to a quotient space, followed by an embedding.\n\n3. **Main idea and hypothesis:** To study geospatial ontologies algebraically as a system, using homomorphisms to understand transformations and relationships between ontologies.

Geospatial foundation models for image analysis: evaluating and enhancing NASA-IBM Prithvi\u2019s domain adaptability**\n\n1. **Title:** Geospatial foundation models for image analysis: evaluating and enhancing NASA-IBM Prithvi\u2019s domain adaptability\n\n2. **Abstract:** This paper evaluates the recently released NASA-IBM GFM Prithvi for its predictive performance on high-level image analysis tasks across multiple benchmark datasets.  New strategies, including band adaptation, multi-scale feature generation, and fine-tuning techniques, are introduced and integrated into an image analysis pipeline to enhance Prithvi's domain adaptation capability and improve model performance.\n\n3. **Main idea and hypothesis:** To evaluate the performance and domain adaptability of the NASA-IBM Prithvi geospatial foundation model and to enhance its performance through various adaptation and enhancement strategies.  The hypothesis is that Prithvi, with appropriate adaptations, will perform well on diverse geospatial image analysis tasks and that the proposed enhancements will improve its performance.\n\n4. **Summary of Results:** Prithvi demonstrates strong performance in object detection and instance segmentation across four diverse datasets, particularly when enhanced with multi-scale feature processing and pre-trained weights.

Model Generalization in Deep Learning Applications for Land Cover Mapping**\n\n1. **Title:** Model Generalization in Deep Learning Applications for Land Cover Mapping\n\n2. **Abstract:** We show that when these deep learning models are trained on data from specific continents/seasons, there is a high degree of variability in model performance on out-of-sample continents/seasons.  We then use clustering techniques on satellite imagery from different continents to visualize the differences in landscapes that make geospatial generalization particularly difficult.\n\n3. **Main idea and hypothesis:** To investigate the generalization ability of deep learning models for land cover mapping across different continents and seasons. The hypothesis is that models trained on data from one region may not generalize well to other regions due to differences in landscape characteristics.\n\n4. **Summary of Results:** Models trained on data from one continent or season show lower accuracy when tested on data from other continents or seasons.  Clustering analysis reveals that different continents have distinct landscape characteristics, which may explain the poor generalization.  The paper suggests caution when applying models trained in one area to another and advocates for training models on diverse data.",
