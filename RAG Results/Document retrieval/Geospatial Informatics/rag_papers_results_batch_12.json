Despite their prevalence in geospatial tasks, neural network models usually assume spatial stationarity, which could limit their performance in the presence of spatial process heterogeneity. We propose to model spatial process heterogeneity at the regional level rather than at the individual level, which largely reduces the number of spatially varying parameters. We further develop a heuristic optimization procedure to learn the region partition adaptively in the process of model training. Our proposed spatial-heterogeneity-aware graph convolutional network, named RegionGCN, is applied to the spatial prediction of county-level vote share in the 2016 US presidential election based on socioeconomic attributes. Results show that RegionGCN achieves significant improvement over the basic and geographically weighted GCNs.\n\n3. **Main idea and hypothesis:**  The main idea is to improve the accuracy of graph convolutional networks (GCNs) for spatial prediction by explicitly modeling spatial heterogeneity at the regional level, rather than the individual unit level, to mitigate overfitting. The hypothesis is that a regionally weighted GCN (RegionGCN) will outperform standard GCNs and geographically weighted GCNs (GWGCNs) because it reduces the number of parameters while still capturing spatial heterogeneity.\n\n4. **Summary of Results:** RegionGCN significantly outperformed standard GCNs and GWGCNs in predicting county-level vote share in the 2016 US Presidential election.  The adaptive region optimization procedure effectively learned the optimal regional partition.  Ensemble learning of multiple regional partitions provided a tool for exploratory analysis of spatially heterogeneous relationships.\n\n\n**Paper 2: Towards Vision-Language Geo-Foundation Model: A Survey**\n\n1. **Title:** Towards Vision-Language Geo-Foundation Model: A Survey\n\n2. **Abstract:** Vision-Language Foundation Models (VLFMs) have made remarkable progress on various multimodal tasks...However, most methods rely on training with general image datasets, and the lack of geospatial data leads to poor performance on earth observation. This paper thoroughly reviews VLGFMs, summarizing and analyzing recent developments in the field. In particular, we introduce the background and motivation behind the rise of VLGFMs, highlighting their unique research significance. Then, we systematically summarize the core technologies employed in VLGFMs, including data construction, model architectures, and applications of various multimodal geospatial tasks. Finally, we conclude with insights, issues, and discussions regarding future research directions.\n\n3. **Main idea and hypothesis:** The main idea is to provide a comprehensive survey of Vision-Language Geo-Foundation Models (VLGFMs), a new area of research focusing on applying vision-language models to geospatial data.  The implicit hypothesis is that VLGFMs represent a significant advancement in geospatial AI, offering improved performance and generalizability over previous methods.\n\n4. **Summary of Results:** The survey categorized VLGFMs into contrastive, conversational, and generative types, detailing their architectures and data pipelines.  It identified key challenges, including low image resolution, high training costs, and limited benchmarks.  The survey also proposed future research directions, such as using more powerful LLMs, developing more challenging benchmarks, and exploring training-free technologies.\n\n\n**Paper 3: More than Correlation: Do Large Language Models Learn Causal Representations of Space?**\n\n1. **Title:** More than Correlation: Do Large Language Models Learn Causal Representations of Space?\n\n2. **Abstract:** Recent work found high mutual information between the learned representations of large language models (LLMs) and the geospatial property of its input, hinting an emergent internal model of space. However, whether this internal space model has any causal effects on the LLMs\u2019 behaviors was not answered by that work, led to criticism of these findings as mere statistical correlation. Our study focused on uncovering the causality of the spatial representations in LLMs. Our casual intervention experiments showed that the spatial representations influenced the model\u2019s performance on next word prediction and a downstream task that relies on geospatial information.\n\n3. **Main idea and hypothesis:** The main idea is to investigate whether the spatial representations learned by LLMs are causally related to their performance on geospatial tasks, going beyond simple correlation. The hypothesis is that manipulating the internal spatial representations of LLMs will causally affect their output and performance on tasks involving spatial information.\n\n4. **Summary of Results:**  Using representational similarity analysis and probing classifiers, the authors demonstrated that DeBERTa-v2 and GPT-Neo learned spatial representations.  Causal intervention experiments showed that modifying these representations affected the models' performance on next-word prediction and a country-prediction task.  The results suggest that LLMs do learn and utilize an internal model of space.\n\n\n**Paper 4: A General-Purpose Neural Architecture for Geospatial Systems**\n\n1. **Title:** A General-Purpose Neural Architecture for Geospatial Systems\n\n2. **Abstract:** Geospatial Information Systems are used by researchers and Humanitarian Assistance and Disaster Response (HADR) practitioners to support a wide variety of important applications. However, collaboration between these actors is difficult due to the heterogeneous nature of geospatial data modalities and diversity of tasks. In this work, we present a roadmap towards the construction of a general-purpose neural architecture (GPNA) with a geospatial inductive bias, pre-trained on large amounts of unlabelled earth observation data in a self-supervised manner. We envision how such a model may facilitate cooperation between members of the community. We show preliminary results on the first step of the roadmap, where we instantiate an architecture that can process a wide variety of geospatial data modalities and demonstrate that it can achieve competitive performance with domain-specific architectures on tasks relating to the U.N.\u2019s Sustainable Development Goals.\n\n3. **Main idea and hypothesis:** The main idea is to develop a general-purpose neural architecture (GPNA) for geospatial systems that can handle diverse data modalities and tasks, improving collaboration and efficiency in humanitarian assistance and disaster response. The hypothesis is that a GPNA, pre-trained on large unlabeled geospatial datasets, will achieve competitive performance on a range of tasks compared to specialized models.\n\n4. **Summary of Results:** The authors presented a roadmap for building a GPNA with a geospatial inductive bias, including pre-training and zero-shot generalization capabilities.  Preliminary results showed that their implemented GPNA achieved competitive performance on several SustainBench tasks related to the UN Sustainable Development Goals, outperforming specialized models on some tasks.  Challenges and future directions were discussed.\n\n\n**Paper 5: SRAI: Towards Standardization of Geospatial AI**\n\n1. **Title:** SRAI: Towards Standardization of Geospatial AI\n\n2. **Abstract:** (Not provided)\n\n3. **Main idea and hypothesis:** The main idea is to introduce a new Python library, Spatial Representations for Artificial Intelligence (srai), designed to standardize geospatial data processing and representation learning. The hypothesis is that a unified API for common geospatial tasks and models will facilitate reproducibility, reusability, and collaboration in the GeoAI field.\n\n4. **Summary of Results:** The paper describes the srai library's architecture and functionalities, including loaders, regionalizers, joiners, embedders, pre-trained models, and utilities. It presents usage examples demonstrating its capabilities in various geospatial tasks. Future work includes migrating to more memory-efficient backends (like DuckDB) and providing pre-calculated embeddings.
