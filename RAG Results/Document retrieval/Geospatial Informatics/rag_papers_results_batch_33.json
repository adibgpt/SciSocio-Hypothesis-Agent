However, a research gap exists to support fully autonomous GIS agents: how to enable agents to discover and download the necessary data for geospatial analyses. This study proposes an autonomous GIS agent framework capable of retrieving required geospatial data by generating, executing, and debugging programs. The framework utilizes the LLM as the decision-maker, selects the appropriate data source (s) from a pre-defined source list, and fetches the data from the chosen source. Each data source has a handbook that records the metadata and technical details for data retrieval. The proposed framework is designed in a plug-and-play style to ensure flexibility and extensibility. Human users or autonomous data scrawlers can add new data sources by adding new handbooks. We developed a prototype agent based on the framework, released as a QGIS plugin (GeoData Retrieve Agent) and a Python program. Experiment results demonstrate its capability of retrieving data from various sources including OpenStreetMap, administrative boundaries and demographic data from the US Census Bureau, satellite basemaps from ESRI World Imagery, global digital elevation model (DEM) from OpenTopography.org, weather data from a commercial provider, the COVID-19 cases from the NYTimes GitHub. Our study is among the first attempts to develop an autonomous geospatial data retrieval agent.\n\n3. **Main idea and hypothesis:**  The main idea is to create an autonomous GIS agent capable of retrieving geospatial data from various sources using natural language instructions and LLMs. The underlying hypothesis is that LLMs, combined with structured metadata (handbooks), can successfully generate, execute, and debug code to retrieve data from diverse online and local sources.\n\n4. **Summary of Results:** A prototype agent was developed and tested, achieving an 80-90% success rate in retrieving data from six different sources (OpenStreetMap, US Census data, weather data, ESRI satellite imagery, COVID-19 data, and OpenTopography DEMs). The agent was implemented as both a QGIS plugin and a Python program.  The study highlights the framework\u2019s extensibility and potential for automating geospatial data retrieval for autonomous GIS.\n\n\n**Paper 2:**\n\n1. **Title:** Context Trees: Augmenting Geospatial Trajectories with Context\n\n2. **Abstract:** Exposing latent knowledge in geospatial trajectories has the potential to provide a better understanding of the movements of individuals and groups. Motivated by such a desire, this work presents the context tree, a new hierarchical data structure that summarises the context behind user actions in a single model. We propose a method for context tree construction that augments geospatial trajectories with land usage data to identify such contexts. Through evaluation of the construction method and analysis of the properties of generated context trees, we demonstrate the foundation for understanding and modelling behaviour a\u21b5orded. Summarising user contexts into a single data structure gives easy access to information that would otherwise remain latent, providing the basis for better understanding and predicting the actions and behaviours of individuals and groups. Finally, we also present a method for pruning context trees, for use in applications where it is desirable to reduce the size of the tree while retaining useful information.\n\n3. **Main idea and hypothesis:** The main idea is to create a hierarchical data structure (context tree) to represent the context of user actions from geospatial trajectories. The hypothesis is that augmenting geospatial trajectories with land-use data, followed by a specific filtering and clustering process, will effectively reveal meaningful contextual information about user behavior and can be represented in a hierarchical structure.\n\n4. **Summary of Results:** The paper introduces the context tree data structure and a method for its construction.  Evaluation, lacking a true ground truth, focuses on comparing the generated trees to expectations based on the data and demonstrating that the proposed methods (augmentation, filtering, clustering, and pruning) produce more meaningful context trees than simpler, naive methods.  The results suggest the effectiveness of the proposed approach in summarizing user contexts for behavioral understanding and prediction.\n\n\n**Paper 3:**\n\n1. **Title:** SalienTime: User-driven Salient Time Steps Selection for Geospatial Visualization\n\n2. **Abstract:**  (Not provided in the excerpt)\n\n3. **Main idea and hypothesis:** The paper aims to develop a method for selecting salient time steps from large-scale spatiotemporal geospatial datasets, guided by user preferences and data characteristics.  The hypothesis is that a combination of structural and statistical cost functions, optimized using dynamic programming, will effectively identify time steps representing significant changes, anomalies, and extrema, resulting in a more efficient and informative visualization for the user.\n\n4. **Summary of Results:** The proposed method, using a dynamic programming approach with a cost function combining structural (CNN-based autoencoder) and statistical (aggregation-based) features, outperforms even selection and arc-based selection in terms of data summarizability (measured by PSNR and RMSE).  The method also effectively identifies anomalies and extrema in the data. A web-based system is developed to incorporate this method with interactive visualizations, allowing users to adjust parameters and explore the data more efficiently. User studies confirm the effectiveness of the system in improving temporal navigation and data understanding.\n\n\n**Paper 4:**\n\n1. **Title:** Into the Unknown: Generating Geospatial Descriptions for New Environments\n\n2. **Abstract:** Similar to vision-and-language navigation (VLN) tasks that focus on bridging the gap between vision and language for embodied navigation, the new Rendezvous (RVS) task requires reasoning over allocentric spatial relationships (independent of the observer\u2019s viewpoint) using non-sequential navigation instructions and maps. However, performance substantially drops in new environments with no training data. Using opensource descriptions paired with coordinates (e.g., Wikipedia) provides training data but suffers from limited spatially-oriented text resulting in low geolocation resolution. We propose a large-scale augmentation method for generating high-quality synthetic data for new environments using readily available geospatial data. Our method constructs a grounded knowledge-graph, capturing entity relationships. Sampled entities and relations (\u201cshop north of school\u201d) generate navigation instructions via (i) generating numerous templates using context-free grammar (CFG) to embed specific entities and relations; (ii) feeding the entities and relation into a large language model (LLM) for instruction generation. A comprehensive evaluation on RVS, showed that our approach improves the 100-meter accuracy by 45.83% on unseen environments. Furthermore, we demonstrate that models trained with CFG-based augmentation achieve superior performance compared with those trained with LLM-based augmentation, both in unseen and seen environments. These findings suggest that the potential advantages of explicitly structuring spatial information for text-based geospatial reasoning in previously unknown, can unlock data-scarce scenarios.\n\n\n3. **Main idea and hypothesis:** The main idea is to address the data scarcity problem in the Rendezvous (RVS) navigation task by generating synthetic navigation instructions for unseen environments. The hypothesis is that a data augmentation method using a knowledge graph derived from OpenStreetMap and either a context-free grammar (CFG) or an LLM will significantly improve the performance of models on the RVS task, especially in unseen environments.\n\n4. **Summary of Results:**  The proposed augmentation method, using OpenStreetMap data to create a knowledge graph, significantly improved the performance of a T5 model on the RVS task.  The CFG-based method outperformed the LLM-based method, achieving a 9.1% absolute increase in 100-meter accuracy and a 39-meter decrease in median distance error on unseen environments. The results highlight the benefits of explicitly structuring spatial information in synthetic data generation for geospatial NLP tasks.  The study also points out limitations related to data dependence, rule-based scalability, and the lack of visual cues in the current approach.",
