Graph Theory Applications in Advanced Geospatial Research**\n\n1. **Title:** Graph Theory Applications in Advanced Geospatial Research\n2. **Abstract:** Geospatial sciences include a wide range of applications, from environmental monitoring transportation to infrastructure planning, as well as location-based analysis and services. Graph theory algorithms in mathematics have emerged as indispensable tools in these domains due to their capability to model and analyse spatial relationships efficiently. This article explores the applications of graph theory algorithms in geospatial sciences, highlighting their role in network analysis, spatial connectivity, geographic information systems, and various other spatial problem-solving scenarios like digital twin. The article provides a comprehensive idea about graph theory's key concepts and algorithms that assist the geospatial modelling processes and insights into real-world geospatial challenges and opportunities. It lists the extensive research, innovative technologies and methodologies implemented in this domain.\n3. **Main idea and hypothesis:** The paper explores the applications of graph theory algorithms in various geospatial domains, hypothesizing that graph-based approaches offer efficient solutions for modeling and analyzing spatial relationships and solving complex geospatial problems.\n4. **Summary of Results:** The paper reviews numerous applications of graph theory in geospatial research, including route planning, facility search, minimum spanning tree construction, forest patch connectivity analysis, network modeling, rural electrification planning, stormwater management, urban accessibility analysis during earthquakes, emergency evacuation planning, vulnerability assessment of spatial networks, and the development of geospatial digital twins.  The results highlight the versatility and effectiveness of graph theory in addressing diverse real-world geospatial challenges.\n\n\n**2. Do Sentence Transformers Learn Quasi-Geospatial Concepts from General Text?**\n\n1. **Title:** Do Sentence Transformers Learn Quasi-Geospatial Concepts from General Text?\n2. **Abstract:** Sentence transformers are language models designed to perform semantic search. This study investigates the capacity of sentence transformers, fine-tuned on general question-answering datasets for asymmetric semantic search, to associate descriptions of human-generated routes across Great Britain with queries often used to describe hiking experiences. We find that sentence transformers have some zero-shot capabilities to understand quasi-geospatial concepts, such as route types and difficulty, suggesting their potential utility for routing recommendation systems.\n3. **Main idea and hypothesis:** The paper investigates whether sentence transformers, trained on general language data, can understand and associate textual descriptions of hiking routes with queries describing hiking preferences (quasi-geospatial concepts) without explicit geospatial training.\n4. **Summary of Results:** The results are mixed. While the models showed some ability to associate simple queries (e.g., \"seaside walk\") with relevant route attributes, performance was inconsistent and less effective for more complex or subjective queries (e.g., \"walk for an expert hiker\").  The study suggests that sentence transformers possess some zero-shot capabilities for quasi-geospatial understanding but require further development for robust and reliable performance in routing recommendation systems.\n\n\n**3. Geospatial Knowledge Graphs**\n\n1. **Title:** Geospatial Knowledge Graphs\n2. **Abstract:** Geospatial knowledge graphs have emerged as a novel paradigm for representing and reasoning over geospatial information. In this framework, entities such as places, people, events, and observations are depicted as nodes, while their relationships are represented as edges. This graph-based data format lays the foundation for creating a \"FAIR\" (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable) environment, facilitating the management and analysis of geographic information. This entry first introduces key concepts in knowledge graphs along with their associated standardization and tools. It then delves into the application of knowledge graphs in geography and environmental sciences, emphasizing their role in bridging symbolic and subsymbolic GeoAI to address cross-disciplinary geospatial challenges. At the end, new research directions related to geospatial knowledge graphs are outlined.\n3. **Main idea and hypothesis:** The paper argues that geospatial knowledge graphs provide a superior method for representing and reasoning about geospatial information compared to traditional databases, enabling FAIR data management and facilitating the integration of symbolic and subsymbolic GeoAI approaches.\n4. **Summary of Results:** The paper describes the structure and implementation of knowledge graphs (using RDF and property graphs), their standardization (GeoSPARQL, OWL-Time), and their applications in various geographic and environmental domains (KnowWhereGraph, UFOKN).  It highlights the potential of knowledge graphs to integrate diverse datasets, improve data interoperability, and bridge symbolic and subsymbolic AI methods for advanced geospatial reasoning and analysis.  The paper also identifies challenges and future research directions, including the need for better integration of geospatial semantics and multimodal data within the knowledge graph framework.\n\n\n**4. Prithvi-EO-2.0: A Versatile Multi-Temporal Foundation Model for Earth Observation Applications**\n\n1. **Title:** Prithvi-EO-2.0: A Versatile Multi-Temporal Foundation Model for Earth Observation Applications\n2. **Abstract:** This technical report presents Prithvi-EO-2.0, a new geospatial foundation model that offers significant improvements over its predecessor, Prithvi-EO-1.0. Trained on 4.2M global time series samples from NASA\u2019s Harmonized Landsat and Sentinel-2 data archive at 30m resolution, the new 300M and 600M parameter models incorporate temporal and location embeddings for enhanced performance across various geospatial tasks. Through extensive benchmarking with GEO-Bench, the 600M version outperforms the previous Prithvi-EO model by 8% across a range of tasks. It also outperforms six other geospatial foundation models when benchmarked on remote sensing tasks from different domains and resolutions (i.e. from 0.1m to 15m). The results demonstrate the versatility of the model in both classical earth observation and high-resolution applications. Early involvement of end-users and subject matter experts (SMEs) are among the key factors that contributed to the project\u2019s success. In particular, SME involvement allowed for constant feedback on model and dataset design, as well as successful customization for diverse SME-led applications in disaster response, land use and crop mapping, and ecosystem dynamics monitoring. Prithvi-EO-2.0 is available on Hugging Face and IBM TerraTorch, with additional resources on GitHub. The project exemplifies the Trusted Open Science approach embraced by all involved organizations.\n3. **Main idea and hypothesis:** The paper introduces Prithvi-EO-2.0, a new multi-temporal geospatial foundation model, hypothesizing that incorporating temporal and location embeddings, along with a larger, globally representative training dataset, will improve its performance and generalizability across various Earth observation tasks compared to its predecessor and other existing models.\n4. **Summary of Results:** Prithvi-EO-2.0 outperforms its predecessor and other leading geospatial foundation models on the GEO-Bench benchmark, demonstrating improved performance across classification and segmentation tasks.  Further,  SME-led downstream task evaluations in disaster response (flood, wildfire, burn intensity, landslide mapping), land use/cover mapping (crop segmentation, land cover classification), and ecosystem dynamics (GPP and AGB estimation) showcase the model's versatility and effectiveness in real-world applications.  The results highlight the model's data efficiency and ability to generalize across different spatial resolutions and domains.\n\n\n**5. GDTM: An Indoor Geospatial Tracking Dataset with Distributed Multimodal Sensors**\n\n1. **Title:** GDTM: An Indoor Geospatial Tracking Dataset with Distributed Multimodal Sensors\n2. **Abstract:** Constantly locating moving objects, i.e., geospatial tracking, is essential for autonomous building infrastructure. Accurate and robust geospatial tracking often leverages multimodal sensor fusion algorithms, which require large datasets with time-aligned, synchronized data from various sensor types. However, such datasets are not readily available. Hence, we propose GDTM, a nine-hour dataset for multimodal object tracking with distributed multimodal sensors and reconfigurable sensor node placements. Our dataset enables the exploration of several research problems, such as optimizing architectures for processing multimodal data, and investigating models\u2019 robustness to adverse sensing conditions and sensor placement variances. A GitHub repository containing the code, sample data, and checkpoints of this work is available at https://github.com/nesl/GDTM.\n3. **Main idea and hypothesis:** The paper introduces GDTM, a new multimodal dataset for indoor geospatial tracking, hypothesizing that the dataset's size, diversity of sensor modalities, and variations in sensor placement will enable the development of more robust and accurate multimodal sensor fusion algorithms for indoor environments.\n4. **Summary of Results:** The paper describes the creation and characteristics of GDTM, a nine-hour dataset collected using three sensor nodes equipped with various sensors (LiDAR, stereo cameras, mmWave radar, microphone arrays) and an OptiTrack motion capture system for ground truth. Two baseline experiments are presented: one comparing early and late fusion architectures for multimodal data and another assessing model robustness to changes in sensor placement. The results demonstrate that multimodal fusion, particularly early fusion, improves tracking accuracy, especially under poor lighting conditions.  The experiments also highlight the challenges of creating models robust to sensor placement variations, emphasizing the utility of GDTM for future research in this area.",
