Molecular docking and binding mode analysis of selected FDA approved drugs against COVID-19 selected key protein targets: An effort towards drug repurposing to identify the combination therapy to combat COVID-19**\n\n1. **Title:** Molecular docking and binding mode analysis of selected FDA approved drugs against COVID-19 selected key protein targets: An effort towards drug repurposing to identify the combination therapy to combat COVID-19\n2. **Abstract:** The emergence of COVID-19 has severely compromised the arsenal of antiviral and antibiotic drugs. Drug repurposing is an attractive alternative approach.  The authors selected three key viral proteins (ACE2, NSP12, NSP16) and four FDA-approved drugs (chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, remdesivir, arbidol) to investigate potential binding affinities and identify key amino acid residues involved in their mechanism of action.\n3. **Main idea and hypothesis:** To identify potential drug combinations targeting different key viral proteins to combat COVID-19 through molecular docking studies of FDA-approved drugs.\n4. **Summary of Results:** Docking studies showed interactions of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine with ACE2 and NSP12, suggesting potential binding affinities.  Results for NSP16 were inconclusive.  The authors emphasize the need for further studies (molecular dynamics, in-vitro/in-vivo) to validate these findings and identify effective combination therapies.\n\n\n**6.  A novel network-based, AD-specific drug repurposing approach called MPI.** (Based on the provided excerpt)\n\n1. **Title:** (Not explicitly provided, inferred from the text) A Novel Network-Based Approach for Drug Repurposing in Alzheimer's Disease\n2. **Abstract:** (Not explicitly provided, but the excerpt details the methodology and results)\n3. **Main idea and hypothesis:** To develop a novel network-based method (MPI) for drug repurposing in Alzheimer's Disease (AD) that leverages learned node embeddings to prioritize paths between drug nodes and the AD node, improving upon existing methods like BSL.  The hypothesis is that using learned node embeddings will improve the identification of effective AD drugs.\n4. **Summary of Results:** MPI outperformed BSL in prioritizing drugs with anti-AD evidence (20% improvement).  MPI identified all four FDA-approved AD drugs in its top 50, while BSL only identified one.  Cox proportional-hazard models identified BBB-crossing ACE-INHs and etodolac as having the lowest risk of AD.  The results suggest etodolac, nicotine, and ACE-INHs as viable repurposing candidates.\n\n\nThe remaining papers lack sufficient information in the provided text to allow for a meaningful summary.",
