Note that due to the incomplete nature of some excerpts, some summaries might be less complete than others.\n\n\n**1. B.Sc. Electrical and Electronic Engineering Thesis: ResDTA: Predicting Drug-Target Binding Affinity Using Residual Skip Connections**\n\n1. **Title:** ResDTA: Predicting Drug-Target Binding Affinity Using Residual Skip Connections\n\n2. **Abstract:**  Predicts drug-target binding affinities using deep learning and only sequence information (drug SMILES strings and protein sequences).  The proposed model using residual skip connections outperforms state-of-the-art methods on a benchmark dataset.\n\n3. **Main idea and hypothesis:** The hypothesis is that deep learning models, specifically CNNs with residual skip connections, can accurately predict drug-target binding affinity using only 1D sequence information from drugs (SMILES) and targets (protein sequences), without requiring additional chemical domain knowledge.\n\n4. **Summary of Results:** The ResDTA model, incorporating residual skip connections and a combined stream, achieved the best Concordance Index (CI) performance on the KIBA dataset, outperforming AttentionDTA and other machine and deep learning baselines.  The model's performance is statistically significant (r2m > 0.5).\n\n\n**2. Application of SVM+ in Early Drug Discovery**\n\n1. **Title:** Application of SVM+ in Early Drug Discovery\n\n2. **Abstract:** Explores conformal prediction in the Learning Under Privileged Information (LUPI) paradigm using SVM+.  Applies it to MNIST and three drug discovery datasets.  Finds that using privileged information produces valid models and improves efficiency, but the improvement varies and isn't substantial in drug discovery applications.\n\n3. **Main idea and hypothesis:** The hypothesis is that using privileged information (PI) in the SVM+ framework within a conformal prediction setting will improve the predictive performance of models in drug discovery and provide valid prediction intervals.\n\n4. **Summary of Results:** SVM+ with conformal prediction yielded valid prediction intervals. While SVM on X* (privileged information) generally outperformed other models in prediction accuracy, the improvement from SVM+ over standard SVM on X was marginal in drug discovery datasets.\n\n\n**3. Modular multi\u2013source prediction of drug side\u2013e\ufb00ects with DruGNN**\n\n1. **Title:** Modular multi\u2013source prediction of drug side\u2013e\ufb00ects with DruGNN\n\n2. **Abstract:**  Predicts drug side effects using a Graph Neural Network (GNN) on a heterogeneous graph dataset integrating various data sources (drug structures, genes, interactions).  The model shows promising results and highlights the importance of relational data and specific data subsets.\n\n3. **Main idea and hypothesis:** The hypothesis is that integrating heterogeneous data into a graph representation and using a GNN (DruGNN) will improve the accuracy of drug side-effect prediction compared to methods relying on Euclidean data and that specific data subsets significantly contribute to the model's performance.\n\n4. **Summary of Results:** DruGNN, a GNN-based method, achieved high classification accuracy in predicting drug side effects. The results confirmed the advantage of using relational data (graph structure) and highlighted the importance of specific data subsets (ablation studies).  The model is flexible and can be extended to include new data sources.\n\n\n**4. Heter-LP: A heterogeneous label propagation algorithm and its application in drug repositioning**\n\n1. **Title:** Heter-LP: A heterogeneous label propagation algorithm and its application in drug repositioning\n\n2. **Abstract:** Proposes a novel semi-supervised heterogeneous label propagation algorithm (Heter-LP) for drug repositioning.  Integrates multi-source data (drugs, diseases, targets) into a heterogeneous network.  Demonstrates effectiveness through statistical and experimental analysis.\n\n3. **Main idea and hypothesis:** The hypothesis is that a heterogeneous label propagation algorithm can effectively integrate multi-source data to predict drug-target, disease-target, and drug-disease associations, improving accuracy and enabling prediction for new drugs and targets compared to existing methods.\n\n4. **Summary of Results:** Heter-LP outperformed several state-of-the-art methods in predicting drug-target interactions in 10-fold cross-validation.  It also successfully predicted interactions for \"new\" drugs and targets (those with no known interactions in the training data).  The algorithm's convergence is proven, and a regularization framework is presented.\n\n\n**5. Learning to Complement Humans** (Only metadata provided)\n\nThis paper's content is not provided, so no summary can be given.\n\n\n**6.  A Human-in-the-Loop Approach for Accelerated Drug Discovery** (Excerpt incomplete)\n\n1. **Title:** A Human-in-the-Loop Approach for Accelerated Drug Discovery\n\n2. **Abstract:** Not fully available in the provided excerpt.\n\n3. **Main idea and hypothesis:** The hypothesis is that a human-in-the-loop approach, integrating Bayesian neural networks, uncertainty quantification, and human expert knowledge, will significantly accelerate and improve the efficiency of drug discovery compared to algorithms or human experts working alone.\n\n4. **Summary of Results:** The human-in-the-loop approach significantly outperformed benchmark methods (random, search-based, uncertainty-based, UCB, and train-then-search strategies) in three drug discovery tasks, achieving at least three times the hit rate of random exploration.  Ablation studies showed the importance of both uncertainty-based exploration and human expert knowledge.  The collaboration between human and algorithm demonstrated significant complementarity, with algorithm-to-human delegation showing superior performance.  The level of human expertise significantly impacted the results.  The algorithm's meta-knowledge (uncertainty quantification) was crucial for effective human-algorithm collaboration.",
