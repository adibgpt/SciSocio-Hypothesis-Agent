Our novel contribution, InstructMol, a multi-modal LLM, effectively aligns molecular structures with natural language via an instruction-tuning approach, utilizing a two-stage training strategy that adeptly combines limited domain-specific data with molecular and textual information. InstructMol showcases substantial performance improvements in drug discovery-related molecular tasks, surpassing leading LLMs and significantly reducing the gap with specialists, thereby establishing a robust foundation for a versatile and dependable drug discovery assistant.\n\n3. **Main Idea and Hypothesis:** The main idea is to develop a multi-modal large language model (InstructMol) that can effectively integrate molecular data (graphs and sequences) with natural language to perform various drug discovery tasks. The underlying hypothesis is that by using a two-stage instruction-tuning approach (alignment pretraining followed by task-specific fine-tuning), InstructMol can achieve better performance than existing LLMs and reduce the gap with specialized models, even with limited domain-specific data.\n\n4. **Summary of Results:** InstructMol significantly outperforms leading LLMs in compound property prediction (both regression and classification), molecule description generation, and chemical reaction analysis (forward prediction, reagent prediction, retrosynthesis).  The two-stage training approach proves effective, and ablation studies show the importance of the alignment pretraining stage and the use of a pre-aligned molecule graph encoder. While still lagging behind some specialized models, InstructMol demonstrates the potential of a versatile and reliable molecular assistant for drug discovery.\n\n\n**Paper 2: Investigating drug translational research using PubMed articles**\n\n1. **Title:** Investigating drug translational research using PubMed articles\n\n2. **Abstract:** Drug research and development are embracing translational research for its potential to increase the number of drugs successfully brought to clinical applications. Using the publicly available PubMed database, we sought to describe the status of drug translational research, the distribution of translational lags for all drugs as well as the collaborations between basic science and clinical science in drug research. For each drug, an indicator called Translational Lag was proposed to quantify the interval time from its first PubMed article to its first clinical article. Meanwhile, the triangle of biomedicine was also used to visualize the status and multidisciplinary collaboration of drug translational research. The results showed that only 18.1% (24,410) of drugs/compounds had been successfully entering clinical research. It averagely took 14.38 years (interquartile range, 4 to 21 years) for a drug from the initial basic discovery to its first clinical research. In addition, the results also revealed that, in drug research, there was rare cooperation between basic science and clinical science, which were more inclined to cooperate within disciplines.\n\n3. **Main Idea and Hypothesis:** The main idea is to quantitatively analyze the status of drug translational research using PubMed data. The implicit hypothesis is that a bibliometric analysis of PubMed articles can reveal insights into the timelines, success rates, and collaborative patterns in drug development.\n\n4. **Summary of Results:** Only 18.1% of drugs/compounds in the PubMed dataset (1965-2018) successfully transitioned to clinical research. The average translational lag (time from first basic research article to first clinical article) was 14.38 years.  The analysis also revealed limited collaboration between basic and clinical scientists, with a preference for intra-disciplinary collaboration.\n\n\n**Paper 3: Repurposing of Ring Framework through TR screening**\n\n1. **Title:** Repurposing of Ring Framework through TR screening\n\n2. **Abstract:** In the drug repurposing approach, the chemically diverse and potentially safe molecules can be explored as therapeutic potential out of those originally targeted indications. However, the intellectual property rights, and competitive over-heating issue from sharing the same drug pipeline information are drawback of the approach. In current paradigm of drug discovery, despite approval of new chemical entity, the finding of a new ring system for drug discovery have stagnated. In addition, there are still rarely used ring systems from FDA approved drug that can be optimized and used for repurposing purpose. In the present work, these rarely used drug ring system were re-purposed with our bidirectional target and ring screening (TR-dual screening) approach within our defined objectives. The TR-dual screening suggested RARbeta and cyproheptadine as a pair of target and ring system. The selected ring system was virtually grown with predefined criterion, ranking of molecular docking and top score poses made us select test compounds for synthesis and biological proof. Among the tested compounds, 6c proved RARbeta agonist activity. The concept of TR dual optimization can contribute to picking either a compound having acceptable ADMET profile or a target for a selected drug scaffold.\n\n3. **Main Idea and Hypothesis:** The main idea is to develop a bidirectional target and ring screening (TR-dual screening) method for drug repurposing, focusing on rarely used ring systems from FDA-approved drugs. The hypothesis is that this approach can identify promising drug candidates with acceptable ADMET profiles by efficiently exploring the chemical space and target space simultaneously.\n\n4. **Summary of Results:** The TR-dual screening method identified RAR\u03b2 (Retinoid Acid Receptor Beta) and the cyproheptadine ring system as a promising target-scaffold pair.  Virtual library generation and molecular docking led to the identification of compound 6c, which showed RAR\u03b2 agonist activity.  The study demonstrates the potential of the TR-dual screening approach for drug repurposing and the identification of novel scaffolds.\n\n\n**Paper 4: Structure-based drug design with geometric deep learning**\n\n1. **Title:** Structure-based drug design with geometric deep learning\n\n2. **Abstract:** Structure-based drug design uses three-dimensional geometric information of macromolecules, such as proteins or nucleic acids, to identify suitable ligands. Geometric deep learning, an emerging concept of neural-network-based machine learning, has been applied to macromolecular structures. This review provides an overview of the recent applications of geometric deep learning in bioorganic and medicinal chemistry, highlighting its potential for structure-based drug discovery and design. Emphasis is placed on molecular property prediction, ligand binding site and pose prediction, and structure-based de novo molecular design. The current challenges and opportunities are highlighted, and a forecast of the future of geometric deep learning for drug discovery is presented.\n\n3. **Main Idea and Hypothesis:** This is a review article, not a research paper proposing a hypothesis. The main idea is to review the applications of geometric deep learning in structure-based drug design, highlighting its potential and challenges.\n\n4. **Summary of Results:** The review summarizes various geometric deep learning methods applied to structure-based drug design tasks, including molecular property prediction (binding affinity, protein function), binding site and interface prediction, binding pose generation and molecular docking, and de novo molecular design. Different molecular representations (grids, surfaces, graphs) and their associated symmetry considerations are discussed. The review concludes by highlighting current challenges and future opportunities for geometric deep learning in drug discovery.\n\n\n**Paper 5: NovoMol: Recurrent Neural Network for Orally Bioavailable Drug Design**\n\n1. **Title:** NovoMol: Recurrent Neural Network for Orally Bioavailable Drug Design\n\n2. **Abstract:** (Not explicitly provided, but inferred from the text)\n\n3. **Main Idea and Hypothesis:** The main idea is to develop a recurrent neural network (NovoMol) for de novo drug design, specifically focusing on generating orally bioavailable drug candidates. The hypothesis is that an LSTM-based recurrent neural network, iteratively trained and optimized using transfer learning, can effectively learn to generate molecules with desirable properties (high QED) for oral bioavailability.\n\n4. **Summary of Results:** NovoMol successfully generated novel and diverse molecules with high QED scores (quantitative estimate of drug-likeness), indicating good oral bioavailability.  Iterative transfer learning significantly improved the model\u2019s performance, resulting in a substantial increase in the percentage of molecules passing oral bioavailability thresholds.  When retrained on a dataset of PDGFR\u03b1 inhibitors, NovoMol generated several candidates with both high QED and better binding affinity than imatinib, a current standard-of-care drug.  This demonstrates the potential of NovoMol for efficient de novo drug design and its applicability to specific drug targets.",
