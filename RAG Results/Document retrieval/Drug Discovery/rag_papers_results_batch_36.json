KGML-xDTD: A Knowledge Graph-based Machine Learning Framework for Drug Treatment Prediction and Mechanism Description**\n\n1. **Title:** KGML-xDTD: A Knowledge Graph-based Machine Learning Framework for Drug Treatment Prediction and Mechanism Description\n\n2. **Abstract:** Computational drug repurposing is a cost- and time-efficient approach that aims to identify new therapeutic targets or diseases (indications) of existing drugs/compounds.  It is especially critical for emerging and/or orphan diseases due to its cheaper investment and shorter research cycle compared with traditional wet-lab drug discovery approaches. However, the underlying mechanisms of action (MOAs) between repurposed drugs and their target diseases remain largely unknown, which is still a main obstacle for computational drug repurposing methods to be widely adopted in clinical settings.  This work proposes KGML-xDTD: a Knowledge Graph-based Machine Learning framework for explainably predicting Drugs Treating Diseases. It is a two-module framework that not only predicts the treatment probabilities between drugs/compounds and diseases but also biologically explains them via knowledge graph (KG) path-based, testable mechanisms of action (MOAs). We leverage knowledge-and-publication based information to extract biologically meaningful \"demonstration paths\" as the intermediate guidance in the Graph-based Reinforcement Learning (GRL) path-finding process.\n\n3. **Main idea and hypothesis:** The hypothesis is that a two-module framework combining a drug repurposing prediction module and a mechanism of action (MOA) explanation module, using reinforcement learning guided by \"demonstration paths,\" will improve both the accuracy of drug repurposing predictions and provide biologically plausible explanations.\n\n4. **Summary of Results:** The KGML-xDTD framework achieved state-of-the-art performance in both drug repurposing prediction and MOA path recapitulation compared to existing methods. Case studies demonstrated the framework's ability to identify biologically relevant paths, providing explanations for drug repurposing predictions.\n\n\n**46. Optimizing Area Under the Curve Measures via Matrix Factorization for Predicting Drug-Target Interaction with Multiple Similarities**\n\n1. **Title:** Optimizing Area Under the Curve Measures via Matrix Factorization for Predicting Drug-Target Interaction with Multiple Similarities\n\n2. **Abstract:** In drug discovery, identifying drug-target interactions (DTIs) via experimental approaches is a tedious and expensive procedure. Computational methods efficiently predict DTIs and recommend a small part of potential interacting pairs for further experimental confirmation, accelerating the drug discovery process. Although it has been shown that fusing heterogeneous drug and target similarities can improve the prediction ability, the existing similarity combination methods ignore the interaction consistency for neighbour entities which is more crucial for the DTI prediction model. Furthermore, area under the precision-recall curve (AUPR) that emphasizes the accuracy of top-ranked pairs and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) that heavily punishes the existence of low ranked interacting pairs are two widely used evaluation metrics in DTI prediction. However, the two metrics are seldom considered as losses within existing DTI prediction methods. This paper first proposes two matrix factorization (MF) methods that optimize AUPR and AUC using convex surrogate losses respectively, and then develops an ensemble MF approach takes advantage of the two area under the curve metrics by combining the two single metric based MF models. Both three proposed approaches incorporate a novel local interaction consistency aware similarity interaction method to generate fused drug and target similarities that preserve vital information from the more reliable view.\n\n3. **Main idea and hypothesis:** The hypothesis is that matrix factorization methods optimized directly for AUPR and AUC, combined with a novel similarity integration method focusing on local interaction consistency, will improve drug-target interaction prediction.\n\n4. **Summary of Results:** The proposed MFAUPR and MFAUC models outperformed existing methods in terms of their respective optimized metrics (AUPR and AUC). The ensemble method, MF2A, achieved the best results in both AUPR and AUC and successfully predicted novel drug-target interactions.  The local interaction consistency-aware similarity integration method (LIC) also showed superiority over existing methods.\n\n\n**47. Drug Synergistic Combinations Predictions via Large-Scale Pre-Training and Graph Structure Learning**\n\n1. **Title:** Drug Synergistic Combinations Predictions via Large-Scale Pre-Training and Graph Structure Learning\n\n2. **Abstract:** Drug combination therapy is a well-established strategy for disease treatment with better effectiveness and less safety degradation. However, identifying novel drug combinations through wet-lab experiments is resource intensive due to the vast combinatorial search space. Recently, computational approaches, specifically deep learning models have emerged as an efficient way to discover synergistic combinations. While previous methods reported fair performance, their models usually do not take advantage of multi-modal data and they are unable to handle new drugs or cell lines. In this study, we collected data from various datasets covering various drug related aspects. Then, we take advantage of large-scale pre-training models to generate informative representations and features for drugs, proteins, and diseases. Based on that, a message-passing graph is built on top to propagate information together with graph structure learning flexibility. This is first introduced in the biological networks and enables us to generate pseudo-relations in the graph. Our framework achieves the state-of-the-art results in comparison with other deep learning-based methods on synergistic prediction benchmark datasets. We are also capable of inferencing new drug combination data in a test on an independent set released by AstraZeneca, where 10% of improvement over previous methods is observed. In addition, we\u2019re robust against unseen drugs and surpass almost 15% AU ROC compared to the second best model.\n\n3. **Main idea and hypothesis:** The hypothesis is that a deep learning framework leveraging large-scale pre-training models, multi-modal data, and graph structure learning will improve the prediction of synergistic drug combinations, especially for unseen drugs and cell lines.\n\n4. **Summary of Results:** The proposed framework achieved state-of-the-art results on benchmark datasets for synergistic drug combination prediction. It demonstrated a 10% improvement on an independent AstraZeneca dataset and showed robustness against unseen drugs and cell lines, surpassing other methods by approximately 15% in AU ROC.",
