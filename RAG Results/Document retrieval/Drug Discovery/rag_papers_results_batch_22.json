Note that the provided text does not contain abstracts for all papers, and the hypotheses are inferred from the text, not explicitly stated.\n\n\n**Paper 1: Low Data Drug Discovery with One-shot Learning**\n\n1. **Title:** Low Data Drug Discovery with One-shot Learning\n\n2. **Abstract:** Recent advances in machine learning have made significant contributions to drug discovery. Deep neural networks in particular have been demonstrated to provide significant boosts in predictive power when inferring the properties and activities of small-molecule compounds. However, the applicability of these techniques has been limited by the requirement for large amounts of training data. In this work, we demonstrate how one-shot learning can be used to significantly lower the amounts of data required to make meaningful predictions in drug discovery applications. We introduce a new architecture, the residual LSTM embedding, that, when combined with graph convolutional neural networks, significantly improves the ability to learn meaningful distance metrics over small-molecules. We open source all models introduced in this work as part of DeepChem, an open-source framework for deep-learning in drug discovery.\n\n3. **Main idea and hypothesis:**  The hypothesis is that one-shot learning techniques, combined with a novel residual LSTM architecture and graph convolutional networks, can effectively predict the properties of small molecules even with limited training data, thus overcoming a major limitation in drug discovery.  The paper posits that leveraging related data to learn a distance metric can allow for meaningful predictions with significantly fewer data points than traditional deep learning methods.\n\n4. **Summary of Results:** The residual LSTM model, combined with graph convolutional networks, showed significant improvements in predictive accuracy compared to random forest baselines across three datasets (Tox21, SIDER, MUV) when trained on limited data.  The performance gains were more robust for the Residual LSTM with less data. However, the model showed some difficulty generalizing to new molecular scaffolds (MUV dataset), suggesting limitations in cross-task generalization. The authors open-sourced their models and code as part of the DeepChem library.\n\n\n**Paper 2: Automating reward function configuration for drug design**\n\n1. **Title:** Automating reward function configuration for drug design\n\n2. **Abstract:** Designing reward functions that can guide generative molecular design (GMD) algorithms to desirable areas of chemical space is of critical importance in AI-driven drug discovery. Traditionally, this has been a manual and error-prone task; the selection of appropriate computational methods to approximate biological assays is challenging and the normalisation and aggregation of computed values into a single score even more so, leading to potential reliance on trial-and-error approaches. We propose a novel approach for automated reward configuration that relies solely on experimental data, mitigating the challenges of manual reward adjustment on drug discovery projects. Our method achieves this by constructing a ranking over experimental data based on Pareto dominance over the multi-objective space, then training a neural network to approximate the reward function such that rankings determined by the predicted reward correlate with those determined by the Pareto dominance relation. We validate our method using two case studies.\n\n3. **Main idea and hypothesis:** The hypothesis is that a reward function for guiding generative molecular design can be learned automatically from experimental data alone, eliminating the need for manual configuration and reducing bias. The paper argues that using Pareto dominance to establish preferences over molecules and training a neural network to predict these preferences will lead to a more accurate and efficient reward function than manually designed ones.\n\n4. **Summary of Results:** The authors' method, using Pareto dominance and a neural network, successfully learned reward functions in two case studies.  First, in simulated DMTA cycles using GuacaMol benchmark data, the learned reward function guided a generative model to produce molecules with scores comparable to those generated using the target reward function. Second, using data from four real drug discovery projects, the learned reward functions outperformed human-defined functions, showing improvements of up to 0.4 in Spearman\u2019s correlation against a ground truth evaluation function.  This indicates that the data-driven approach can create superior reward functions for GMD.",
