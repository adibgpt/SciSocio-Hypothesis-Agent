Recent progress in molecular simulation methods for drug binding kinetics**\n\n1. **Title:** Recent progress in molecular simulation methods for drug binding kinetics\n2. **Abstract:** Due to the contribution of drug-target binding kinetics to drug efficacy, there is a high level of interest in developing methods to predict drug-target binding kinetic parameters.  The review assesses the performance of enhanced sampling molecular dynamics simulation-based methods considering two benchmark systems: mutant T4 lysozyme-ligand complexes and a large set of N-HSP90-inhibitor complexes.  The results indicate that some simulation methods can be usefully applied in drug discovery but that further studies on more high-quality experimental benchmark datasets are necessary.\n3. **Main idea and hypothesis:**  The main idea is to review recent advancements in molecular dynamics simulations for predicting drug-target binding kinetics and to assess the accuracy and applicability of these methods in drug discovery. The underlying hypothesis is that enhanced sampling techniques can improve the accuracy of kinetic parameter predictions compared to traditional methods.\n4. **Summary of Results:**  The review found that while some simulation methods provide reasonably accurate predictions of dissociation rates (koff), particularly for congeneric series of compounds,  more high-quality experimental data is needed for better validation and improvement of computational methods.  The computational cost of different methods varied significantly.  Methods with lower computational cost sometimes yielded results as accurate as more computationally expensive methods.\n\n\n**2.

By highlighting the potential of AI to overcome traditional barriers, this review systematically examines how AI addresses critical gaps in anti-addiction research, emphasizing its potential to revolutionize drug discovery and development, overcome challenges, and advance more effective therapeutic strategies.\n3. **Main idea and hypothesis:** The main idea is to explore the application of AI in accelerating and improving anti-addiction drug discovery. The implicit hypothesis is that AI can overcome limitations of traditional methods by improving data analysis, target identification, and compound optimization.\n4. **Summary of Results:** The review demonstrates how AI can enhance each stage of drug discovery for addiction treatment, from data integration and analysis to target identification and lead optimization, including drug repurposing and de novo design.  The authors highlight the potential of AI to address data scarcity, complex biological mechanisms, and ethical considerations in addiction research.\n\n\n**3. Structure-based drug discovery with deep learning**\n\n1. **Title:** Structure-based drug discovery with deep learning\n2. **Abstract:** Arti\ufb01cial intelligence (AI) in the form of deep learning bears promise for drug discovery and chemical biology...While most of the deep learning efforts in drug discovery have focused on ligand-based approaches, structure-based drug discovery has the potential to tackle unsolved challenges...Deep learning for SBDD is still in its infancy but is moving forward at a fast pace, and its relevance in the years to come is expected to increase.\n3. **Main idea and hypothesis:** The main idea is to review the application of deep learning to structure-based drug discovery (SBDD), focusing on its potential to overcome limitations of traditional SBDD methods. The implicit hypothesis is that deep learning can improve the efficiency and accuracy of SBDD tasks such as drug-target interaction prediction, binding site detection, and de novo design.\n4. **Summary of Results:** The review categorizes deep learning approaches for SBDD based on protein representation (sequence, 3D structure, surface). It highlights the use of various deep learning architectures (CNNs, RNNs, transformers) for drug-target interaction prediction, binding site detection, and de novo molecular design.  The authors emphasize the potential of improved protein structure prediction (e.g., AlphaFold) to further enhance SBDD with deep learning.\n\n\n**4. Towards Unified AI Drug Discovery with Multiple Knowledge Modalities**\n\n1. **Title:** Towards Unified AI Drug Discovery with Multiple Knowledge Modalities\n2. **Abstract:** To bridge [the gap between AI models and human expert approaches in drug discovery], we propose KEDD, a unified, end-to-end, and multimodal deep learning framework that optimally incorporates both structured and unstructured knowledge for vast AI drug discovery tasks...Our framework achieves a deeper understanding of molecule entities, brings significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods on a wide range of tasks and benchmarks, and reveals its promising potential in assisting real-world drug discovery.\n3. **Main idea and hypothesis:** The main idea is to develop a unified deep learning framework (KEDD) that integrates multiple knowledge modalities (molecular structure, structured knowledge from knowledge graphs, unstructured knowledge from text) to improve the performance of various AI drug discovery tasks. The hypothesis is that integrating these modalities will lead to more accurate and robust predictions compared to models using only a single modality.\n4. **Summary of Results:** KEDD achieved state-of-the-art performance on several benchmark datasets for drug-target interaction prediction, drug property prediction, drug-drug interaction prediction, and protein-protein interaction prediction. The authors demonstrate that both structured and unstructured knowledge are important for performance, and that their proposed sparse attention mechanism effectively handles missing data.  A case study on ACE2 inhibitors further supports the practical applicability of KEDD.\n\n\n**5.

The implicit hypothesis is that diffusion models can effectively learn the complex probability distributions of 3D molecular structures and generate novel molecules with desired properties relevant to drug discovery.\n4. **Summary of Results:** The review discusses various aspects of diffusion model implementation for 3D molecular generation, including molecular representations (SMILES, graphs), forward and reverse diffusion processes, and denoising neural network architectures (GNNs, CNNs, transformers, hybrid models).  It highlights the successes and limitations of different models in generating stable and valid 3D molecular structures and their application in SBDD tasks like target-specific generation and molecular docking.  The authors also emphasize challenges such as handling chirality and the disconnect between evaluation metrics and real-world performance.",
