Improving Prediction of Phenotypic Drug Response on Cancer Cell Lines Using Deep Convolutional Network**\n\n1. **Title:** Improving Prediction of Phenotypic Drug Response on Cancer Cell Lines Using Deep Convolutional Network\n2. **Abstract:** Understanding the phenotypic drug response on cancer cell lines plays a vital rule in anti-cancer drug discovery and re-purposing. The Genomics of Drug Sensitivity in Cancer (GDSC) database provides open data for researchers in phenotypic screening to test their models and methods. Previously, most research in these areas starts from the fingerprints or features of drugs, instead of their structures. In this paper, we introduce a model for phenotypic screening, which is called twin Convolutional Neural Network for drugs in SMILES format (tCNNS). tCNNS is comprised of CNN input channels for drugs in SMILES format and cancer cell lines respectively. Our model achieves 0.84 for the coefficient of determinant(R2) and 0.92 for Pearson correlation(Rp), which are significantly better than previous works[3, 16, 30]. Besides these statistical metrics, tCNNS also provides some insights into phenotypic screening.\n3. **Main idea and hypothesis:** The main idea is to improve the prediction accuracy of phenotypic drug response on cancer cell lines using a novel deep convolutional neural network (tCNNS) that directly uses the SMILES representation of drugs, rather than relying on pre-extracted features.  The implicit hypothesis is that using the raw SMILES string provides more information leading to better predictive performance than using pre-processed features.\n4. **Summary of Results:**  tCNNS significantly outperforms previous models on the GDSC dataset, achieving R\u00b2 of 0.84 and Rp of 0.92. The model demonstrates robustness even with limited training data and fewer cell line features.  The analysis suggests tCNNS relies on statistical patterns within the SMILES strings rather than solely on their biological meaning.  The model showed better performance in drug repurposing than drug discovery.\n\n\n**2. Scalable Variational Quantum Circuits for Autoencoder-based Drug Discovery**\n\n1. **Title:** Scalable Variational Quantum Circuits for Autoencoder-based Drug Discovery\n2. **Abstract:** The de novo design of drug molecules is recognized as a time-consuming and costly process, and computational approaches have been applied in each stage of the drug discovery pipeline. Variational autoencoder is one of the computer-aided design methods which explores the chemical space based on existing molecular dataset. Quantum machine learning has emerged as an atypical learning method that may speed up some classical learning tasks because of its strong expressive power. However, near-term quantum computers suffer from limited number of qubits which hinders the representation learning in high dimensional spaces. We present a scalable quantum generative autoencoder (SQ-VAE) for simultaneously reconstructing and sampling drug molecules, and a corresponding vanilla variant (SQ-AE) for better reconstruction. The architectural strategies in hybrid quantum classical networks such as, adjustable quantum layer depth, heterogeneous learning rates, and patched quantum circuits are proposed to learn high dimensional dataset such as, ligand-targeted drugs. Extensive experimental results are reported for different dimensions including 8x8 and 32x32 after choosing suitable architectural strategies. The performance of quantum generative autoencoder is compared with the corresponding classical counterpart throughout all experiments. The results show that quantum computing advantages can be achieved for normalized low-dimension molecules, and that high-dimension molecules generated from quantum generative autoencoders have better drug properties within the same learning period.\n3. **Main idea and hypothesis:** The main idea is to develop a scalable quantum variational autoencoder (SQ-VAE) for drug molecule discovery that can handle high-dimensional data. The hypothesis is that a quantum approach, despite limitations of near-term quantum computers, can offer advantages in terms of learning speed and generating molecules with better drug-like properties compared to classical VAEs.\n4. **Summary of Results:**  The study shows that quantum autoencoders (QVAEs/QAEs) outperform classical counterparts on low-dimensional, normalized datasets.  For high-dimensional data, a patched quantum circuit architecture and heterogeneous learning rates were necessary.  The SQ-VAEs generated molecules with better drug-like properties (logP, SA, QED) than classical VAEs within the same training time.\n\n\n**3. Y-Mol: A Multiscale Biomedical Knowledge-Guided Large Language Model for Drug Development**\n\n1. **Title:** Y-Mol: A Multiscale Biomedical Knowledge-Guided Large Language Model for Drug Development\n2. **Abstract:** Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated remarkable performance in general tasks across various fields. However, their effectiveness within specific domains such as drug development remains challenges. To solve these challenges, we introduce Y-Mol, forming a well-established LLM paradigm for the flow of drug development. Y-Mol is a multiscale biomedical knowledge-guided LLM designed to accomplish tasks across lead compound discovery, pre-clinic, and clinic prediction. By integrating millions of multiscale biomedical knowledge and using LLaMA2 as the base LLM, Y-Mol augments the reasoning capability in the biomedical domain by learning from a corpus of publications, knowledge graphs, and expert-designed synthetic data. The capability is further enriched with three types of drug-oriented instructions: description-based prompts from processed publications, semantic-based prompts for extracting associations from knowledge graphs, and template-based prompts for understanding expert knowledge from biomedical tools. Besides, Y-Mol offers a set of LLM paradigms that can autonomously execute the downstream tasks across the entire process of drug development, including virtual screening, drug design, pharmacological properties prediction, and drug-related interaction prediction. Our extensive evaluations of various biomedical sources demonstrate that Y-Mol significantly outperforms general-purpose LLMs in discovering lead compounds, predicting molecular properties, and identifying drug interaction events. The source code is available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/Y-Mol.\n3. **Main idea and hypothesis:** The paper aims to create a large language model (Y-Mol) specifically for drug development by incorporating multiscale biomedical knowledge from publications, knowledge graphs, and expert models. The hypothesis is that incorporating this diverse knowledge base will significantly improve the LLM's performance on various drug development tasks compared to general-purpose LLMs.\n4. **Summary of Results:** Y-Mol outperforms LLaMA2-7b on various drug development tasks, including drug-target interaction prediction, drug design, property prediction, and drug interaction prediction.  The results highlight the effectiveness of the multiscale knowledge integration and the designed instruction datasets in improving the LLM's capabilities.\n\n\n**4. Navigating Healthcare Insights: A Bird\u2019s Eye View of Explainability with Knowledge Graphs**\n\n1. **Title:** Navigating Healthcare Insights: A Bird\u2019s Eye View of Explainability with Knowledge Graphs\n2. **Abstract:** Knowledge graphs (KGs) are gaining prominence in Healthcare AI, especially in drug discovery and pharmaceutical research as they provide a structured way to integrate diverse information sources, enhancing AI system interpretability. This interpretability is crucial in healthcare, where trust and transparency matter, and eXplainable AI (XAI) supports decision-making for healthcare professionals. This overview summarizes recent literature on the impact of KGs in healthcare and their role in developing explainable AI models. We cover KG workflow, including construction, relationship extraction, reasoning, and their applications in areas like Drug-Drug Interactions (DDI), Drug Target Interactions (DTI), Drug Development (DD), Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR), and bioinformatics. We emphasize the importance of making KGs more interpretable through knowledge-infused learning in healthcare. Finally, we highlight research challenges and provide insights for future directions.\n3. **Main idea and hypothesis:** The paper provides a review of the use of knowledge graphs (KGs) in enhancing explainable AI (XAI) in healthcare. The underlying hypothesis is that KGs, due to their structured nature and ability to integrate diverse data, can significantly improve the interpretability and explainability of AI models in healthcare applications.\n4. **Summary of Results:** The paper reviews the workflow of KGs in healthcare XAI, including construction, feature extraction, and reasoning. It highlights the applications of KGs in various drug discovery and healthcare tasks (DDI, DTI, ADR, etc.).  The paper also identifies several open research challenges related to open-world assumptions, knowledge integration, model complexity, benchmarking, user-friendly explanations, and privacy.\n\n\n**TorchDrug: A Powerful and Flexible Machine Learning Platform for Drug Discovery**\n\n1. **Title:** TorchDrug: A Powerful and Flexible Machine Learning Platform for Drug Discovery\n2. **Abstract:** Machine learning has huge potential to revolutionize the field of drug discovery and is attracting increasing attention in recent years.
