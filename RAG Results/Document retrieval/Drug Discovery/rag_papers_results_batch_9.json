To reduce the high levels of attrition throughout the process, there has been a growing interest in applying machine learning methodologies to various stages of drug discovery and development in the recent decade, especially at the earliest stage \u2013 identification of druggable disease genes. In this paper, we have developed a new tensor factorisation model to predict potential drug targets (genes or proteins) for treating diseases. We created a three-dimensional data tensor consisting of 1,048 gene targets, 860 diseases and 230,011 evidence attributes and clinical outcomes connecting them, using data extracted from the Open Targets and PharmaProjects databases. We enriched the data with gene target representations learned from a drug discovery-oriented knowledge graph and applied our proposed method to predict the clinical outcomes for unseen gene target and disease pairs. We designed three evaluation strategies to measure the prediction performance and benchmarked several commonly used machine learning classifiers together with Bayesian matrix and tensor factorization methods. The result shows that incorporating knowledge graph embeddings significantly improves the prediction accuracy and that training tensor factorization alongside a dense neural network outperforms all other baselines. In summary, our framework combines two actively studied machine learning approaches to disease target identification, namely tensor factorization and knowledge graph representation learning, which could be a promising avenue for further exploration in data-driven drug discovery.\n\n3. **Main idea and hypothesis:**  The main idea is to improve the prediction of successful drug targets for diseases by using a tensor factorization model enhanced with knowledge graph embeddings. The hypothesis is that incorporating knowledge graph embeddings, which capture complex relationships between biological entities, will improve the accuracy of predicting clinical outcomes compared to traditional machine learning methods and simpler tensor factorization approaches.\n\n4. **Summary of Results:** The knowledge graph-enhanced tensor factorization model significantly outperformed baseline machine learning classifiers and Bayesian matrix/tensor factorization methods across different evaluation strategies.  Incorporating knowledge graph embeddings dramatically improved prediction accuracy (AUROC and AUPRC). The model effectively utilized various information sources (learned representations, evidence tensor, and knowledge graph embeddings).  An initial qualitative assessment of top predictions showed plausibility in some cases, highlighting the potential for novel target identification but also the challenges of interpretability.\n\n\n**Paper 2:**\n\n1. **Title:** DeepSca\ufb00old: a comprehensive tool for sca\ufb00old-based de novo drug discovery using deep learning\n\n2. **Abstract:** The ultimate goal of drug design is to find novel compounds with desirable pharmacological properties. Designing molecules retaining particular scaffolds as the core structures of the molecules is one of the efficient ways to obtain potential drug candidates with desirable properties. We proposed a scaffold-based molecular generative model for scaffold-based drug discovery, which performs molecule generation based on a wide spectrum of scaffold definitions, including BM-scaffolds, cyclic skeletons, as well as scaffolds with specifications on side-chain properties. The model can generalize the learned chemical rules of adding atoms and bonds to a given scaffold. Furthermore, the generated compounds were evaluated by molecular docking in DRD2 targets and the results demonstrated that this approach can be effectively applied to solve several drug design problems, including the generation of compounds containing a given scaffold and de novo drug design of potential drug candidates with specific docking scores.\n\n3. **Main idea and hypothesis:** The main idea is to develop a deep learning model (DeepScaffold) for scaffold-based de novo drug discovery that can generate molecules based on various scaffold definitions (cyclic skeletons, BM-scaffolds, scaffolds with side-chain specifications). The hypothesis is that this approach will generate molecules with desirable properties and higher bioactivity compared to traditional methods.\n\n4. **Summary of Results:** DeepScaffold successfully generated molecules based on different scaffold types.  Larger scaffolds led to higher validity but lower uniqueness of generated molecules.  The model effectively captured the mean values of molecular properties (MW, LogP, QED) but generated molecules with higher structural diversity than the test set.  A case study on privileged scaffolds for GPCRs demonstrated the model's ability to reproduce known active molecules and generate molecules with potentially improved docking scores, showcasing its potential for drug discovery.  The authors noted the importance of using unbiased benchmark sets for future evaluations.\n\n\n**Paper 3:**\n\n1. **Title:** Collaborative Drug Discovery: Inference-level Data Protection Perspective\n\n2. **Abstract:** Pharmaceutical industry can better leverage its data assets to virtualize drug discovery through a collaborative machine learning platform. On the other hand, there are non-negligible risks stemming from the unintended leakage of participants\u2019 training data, hence, it is essential for such a platform to be secure and privacy-preserving. This paper describes a privacy risk assessment for collaborative modeling in the preclinical phase of drug discovery to accelerate the selection of promising drug candidates. After a short taxonomy of state-of-the-art inference attacks we adopt and customize several to the underlying scenario. Finally we describe and experiments with a handful of relevant privacy protection techniques to mitigate such attacks.\n\n3. **Main idea and hypothesis:** The main idea is to assess the privacy risks associated with collaborative drug discovery using federated learning and propose mitigation strategies. The hypothesis is that even with secure aggregation, inference attacks can reveal sensitive information about participants' training data, and that appropriate mitigation techniques are needed to balance privacy and utility.\n\n4. **Summary of Results:** The authors identified several risks related to the leakage of intellectual property (fingerprints, targets, and model parameters) in a federated learning setting for drug discovery. They designed novel membership inference attacks (Trunk Activation Attack and Naive Gradient-based Membership Attack) that exploit model outputs and gradients, respectively.  Even with secure aggregation, a novel differentiation attack (\"N-1 attack\") showed the feasibility of attributing leaked information to specific participants if the composition of participants changes during training. Differential Privacy was found to provide strong privacy guarantees but at the cost of unacceptable accuracy loss.  However, simpler techniques like regularization, hyperparameter tuning (increasing batch size), and compression (thresholding, Top-K) effectively mitigated the attacks with acceptable utility loss.\n\n\n**Paper 4:**\n\n1. **Title:** Zero-shot Learning of Drug Response Prediction for Preclinical Drug Screening\n\n2. **Abstract:** Conventional deep learning methods typically employ supervised learning for drug response prediction (DRP). This entails dependence on labeled response data from drugs for model training. However, practical applications in the preclinical drug screening phase demand that DRP models predict responses for novel compounds, often with unknown drug responses. This presents a challenge, rendering supervised deep learning methods unsuitable for such scenarios. In this paper, we propose a zero-shot learning solution for the DRP task in preclinical drug screening. Specifically, we propose a Multi-branch Multi-Source Domain Adaptation Test Enhancement Plug-in, called MSDA. MSDA can be seamlessly integrated with conventional DRP methods, learning invariant features from the prior response data of similar drugs to enhance real-time predictions of unlabeled compounds. We conducted experiments using the GDSCv2 and CellMiner datasets. The results demonstrate that MSDA efficiently predicts drug responses for novel compounds, leading to a general performance improvement of 5-10% in the preclinical drug screening phase. The significance of this solution resides in its potential to accelerate the drug discovery process, improve drug candidate assessment, and facilitate the success of drug discovery.\n\n3. **Main idea and hypothesis:** The main idea is to address the limitations of supervised learning in preclinical drug screening by developing a zero-shot learning method (MSDA) for drug response prediction. The hypothesis is that by leveraging information from similar drugs (multi-source domain adaptation), MSDA can improve the prediction accuracy for novel compounds with unknown responses.\n\n4. **Summary of Results:** MSDA significantly improved the performance of several state-of-the-art DRP methods in zero-shot learning scenarios on GDSCv2 and CellMiner datasets, achieving an average improvement of 5-10% across multiple evaluation metrics.  The method effectively utilizes multiple source domains to learn invariant features and adapt to target domains with novel compounds. Ablation studies confirmed the importance of the multi-source domain selection and the target domain adaptation branch in MSDA's success.\n\n\n**Paper 5:**\n\n1. **Title:**  Estimation of Clinical Trial Success Rates and Related Parameters (This title is inferred from the provided text, as the exact title is not explicitly stated)\n\n2. **Abstract:**  Not explicitly provided in excerpt.\n\n3. **Main idea and hypothesis:** The main idea is to estimate the value of pharmaceutical drugs at different stages of development (discovery to market launch) and to analyze how announcements of clinical trial outcomes affect firm market value.  The underlying hypothesis is that market reactions to announcements reflect changes in expected profitability, and this information can be used to estimate the value of drugs at each stage.\n\n4. **Summary of Results:** The authors estimated cumulative abnormal returns (CAR) associated with various announcements (discovery, discontinuation at different phases, FDA application, approval).  Positive announcements had positive CARs, and negative announcements had negative CARs, with the magnitude of the effect increasing in later stages.  They estimated expected discount rates for different development stages using competing risk models.  By combining CAR estimates, discount rates, and transition probabilities, they estimated the expected value of drugs at the discovery stage and at FDA approval.  The analysis considered heterogeneity in firm size and found that negative news had a larger impact than positive news.  The authors recognized limitations such as assumptions about constant per-period profits and the potential impact of information leakage before official announcements.",
