In such cases, researchers rely on analytical methods for observational data to explore causal relationships. Difference-in-differences (DID) is one such method that, most commonly, estimates a difference in some mean outcome in a group before and after the implementation of an intervention or pol-icy and compares this with a control group followed over the same time (i.e., a group that did not implement the intervention or policy). Although DID modeling approaches have been gaining popularity in public health research, the majority of these approaches and their extensions are developed and shared within the economics literature. While extensions of DID modeling approaches may be straightforward to apply to observational data in any field, the complexities and assumptions involved in newer approaches are often misunderstood. In this paper, we focus on recent exten-sions of the DID method and their relationships to linear models in the setting of staggered treatment adoption over multiple years. We detail the identification and estimation of the average treatment effect among the treated using potential outcomes notation, highlighting the assumptions necessary to produce valid estimates. These concepts are described within the context of Medicaid expansion and retention in care among people living with HIV (PWH) in the United States. While each DID approach is potentially valid, understanding their different assumptions and choosing an appropriate method can have important implications for policy-makers, funders, and public health as a whole.\n\n3. **Main Idea and Hypothesis:** The paper aims to clarify and compare different difference-in-differences (DID) methods for evaluating policy effects, especially in situations with staggered adoption (like Medicaid expansion).  The underlying hypothesis is that different DID approaches, while all potentially valid, rely on different assumptions and lead to different interpretations of the average treatment effect on the treated (ATT).  Choosing the wrong method can lead to incorrect policy conclusions.\n\n4. **Summary of Results:** The paper compares several DID approaches and their linear regression model equivalents, highlighting the assumptions (consistency, parallel trends, homogeneous treatment effects) required for valid ATT estimation.  It demonstrates that simpler DID methods assume unconditional parallel trends, while more sophisticated methods allow for conditional parallel trends (controlling for covariates). The paper finds that the validity of estimates depends critically on whether the treatment effect is homogeneous across groups and time.  The authors apply these methods to analyze the effect of Medicaid expansion on HIV patient retention, demonstrating how different approaches yield different estimates and emphasizing the importance of carefully considering the assumptions before selecting a method.  A key finding is that  the simpler TWFE model assumes homogeneous treatment effects across groups and time, which may be unrealistic in many applications.\n\n\n**Paper 2: Short-term Mortality Prediction for Elderly Patients Using Medicare Claims Data**\n\n1. **Title:** Short-term Mortality Prediction for Elderly Patients Using Medicare Claims Data\n\n2. **Abstract:** Risk prediction is central to both clinical medicine and public health. While many machine learning models have been developed to predict mortality, they are rarely applied in the clinical literature, where classification tasks typically rely on logistic regression. One reason for this is that existing machine learning models often seek to optimize predictions by incorporating features that are not present in the databases readily available to providers and policy makers, limiting generalizability and implementation. Here we tested a number of machine learning classifiers for prediction of six-month mortality in a population of elderly Medicare beneficiaries, using an administrative claims database of the kind available to the majority of health care payers and providers. We show that machine learning classifiers substantially outperform current widely-used methods of risk prediction\u2014but only when used with an improved feature set incorporating insights from clinical medicine, developed for this study. Our work has applications to supporting patient and provider decision making at the end of life, as well as population health-oriented efforts to identify patients at high risk of poor outcomes.\n\n3. **Main Idea and Hypothesis:** The paper hypothesizes that machine learning (ML) classifiers can significantly improve short-term mortality prediction in elderly Medicare beneficiaries using readily available administrative claims data, *provided* an enhanced feature set incorporating clinical insights is used.  Existing methods (logistic regression with limited features) are expected to underperform.\n\n4. **Summary of Results:**  The study demonstrates that ML classifiers (specifically, Random Forest) substantially outperform logistic regression in predicting six-month mortality using Medicare claims data. However, this superior performance is only achieved when using a carefully constructed \"augmented\" feature set. This set includes not just the presence/absence of diseases (as in traditional models), but also the *severity* and *temporal progression* of diseases, along with measures of functional status. The best-performing model was a Random Forest classifier using the augmented feature set. The authors found that the performance of the classifiers varied across disease cohorts, and this variation correlated with the difference in disease severity between those who died and those who survived.\n\n\n**Paper 3: System modeling of a health issue: the case of preterm birth in Ohio**\n\n1. **Title:** System modeling of a health issue: the case of preterm birth in Ohio\n\n2. **Abstract:** Preterm birth rate (PBR) stands out as a major public health concern in the U.S. However, effective policies for mitigating the problem is largely unknown. The complexities of the problem raise critical questions: Why is PBR increasing despite the massive investment for reducing it? What policies can decrease it? To address these questions, we develop a causal loop diagram to investigate mechanisms underlying high preterm rate in a community. Our boundary is broad and includes medical and education systems, as well as living conditions such as crime rate and housing price. Then, we built a simulation model and divided the population into two groups based on their chance of delivering a preterm baby. We calibrated the model using the historical data of a case study\u2014Cuyahoga, Ohio\u2014from 1995 to 2017. Prior studies mostly applied reductionist approaches to determine factors associated with high preterm rate at the individual level. Our simulation model examines the reciprocal influences of multiple factors and investigates the effect of different resource allocation scenarios on the PBR. Results show that, in the case of Cuyahoga county with one of the highest rates of PBR in the U.S., estimated preterm birth rates will not be lower than the rates of 1995 during the next five years.\n\n3. **Main Idea and Hypothesis:** The paper hypothesizes that the persistently high preterm birth rate (PBR) in Ohio, particularly Cuyahoga County, is not solely due to factors addressed by current medical interventions during pregnancy.  Instead, it's a complex system problem driven by interconnected social, economic, and environmental factors over a lifetime, including education, crime, poverty and healthcare access.\n\n\n4. **Summary of Results:** Using system dynamics modeling and data from Cuyahoga County, Ohio (1995-2017), the authors demonstrate that the PBR is a complex system with multiple interacting feedback loops.  Their model suggests that focusing solely on medical interventions during pregnancy is insufficient to significantly reduce PBR. The model predicts that PBR in Cuyahoga County will remain high for at least the next five years under current resource allocation strategies.  The study highlights the need for a broader, long-term approach involving investments in education, improved living conditions, and crime reduction to effectively address high PBR.\n\n\n**Paper 4: Mathematically Modeling Spillover Dynamics of Emerging Zoonoses with Intermediate Hosts**\n\n1. **Title:** Mathematically Modeling Spillover Dynamics of Emerging Zoonoses with Intermediate Hosts\n\n2. **Abstract:** The World Health Organization describes zoonotic diseases as a major pandemic threat, and modeling the behavior of such diseases is a key component of their control. Many emerging zoonoses, such as SARS, Nipah, and Hendra, mutated from their wild type while circulating in an intermediate host population, usually a domestic species, to become more transmissible among humans, and moreover, this transmission route will only become more likely as agriculture and trade intensi\ufb01es around the world. Passage through an intermediate host enables many otherwise rare diseases to become better adapted to humans, and so understanding this process with mathematical epidemio-logical models is necessary to prevent epidemics of emerging zoonoses, guide policy interventions in public health, and predict the behavior of an epidemic. In this pa-per, we account for spillovers of a zoonotic disease mutating in an intermediate host by means of modeling transmission dynamics within and between three host species, namely, wild reservoir, intermediate domestic animals, and humans. We calculate the basic reproductive number of the pathogen, present critical conditions for the emer-gence dynamics of zoonosis, and perform stability analysis of admissible disease equi-libria. Our analytical results agree well with long-term simulations of the system. We \ufb01nd that in the presence of biologically realistic interspecies transmission parameters, a zoonotic disease can establish itself in humans even if it fails to persist in its reservoir and intermediate host species. Our model and results can be used to understand the dynamic behavior of any zoonosis with intermediate hosts and assist efforts to protect public health.\n\n3. **Main Idea and Hypothesis:** The paper hypothesizes that a mathematical model incorporating spillover dynamics through an intermediate host can better explain the emergence of zoonotic diseases in humans.  The authors specifically expect that even if a zoonotic disease doesn't establish itself in its wild reservoir or intermediate host, it can still become endemic in humans due to mutation and interspecies transmission.\n\n4. **Summary of Results:** The authors develop a three-species (wild reservoir, intermediate domestic animal, human) SIR model to simulate zoonotic disease emergence. They derive the basic reproductive number (R0) and analyze the stability of disease-free and endemic equilibria.  A key finding is that, with realistic interspecies transmission parameters, a zoonotic disease can become endemic in humans even if it fails to persist in its wild reservoir or intermediate host. This challenges the traditional classification of zoonotic diseases based solely on human-to-human transmissibility.  The model highlights the critical role of interspecies transmission parameters (spillover rates and mutation rate) in determining the overall epidemic dynamics, suggesting that focusing on controlling these parameters through policy interventions (e.g., biosecurity) may be more effective than solely targeting intraspecies transmission rates.\n\n\n**Paper 5: Modeling and forecasting the COVID-19 temporal spread in Greece: an exploratory approach based on complex network defined splines.**\n\n1. **Title:** Modeling and forecasting the COVID-19 temporal spread in Greece: an exploratory approach based on complex network defined splines.\n\n2. **Abstract:** Within the complex framework of anti-COVID-19 health management, where the criteria of diagnostic testing, the availability of public-health resources and services, and the applied anti-COVID-19 policies vary between countries, the reliability and the accuracy in the modeling of temporal spread can be proven effective in the worldwide fight against the disease. This paper applies an exploratory time-series analysis to the evolution of the disease in Greece, which currently suggests a success story of COVID-19 management. The proposed method builds on a recent conceptualization of detecting connective communities in a time-series and develops a novel spline regression model where the knot vector is determined by the community detection in the complex network. Overall, the study contributes to the COVID-19 research by proposing a free of disconnected past-data and reliable framework of forecasting, which can facilitate decision-making and management of the available health resources.\n\n3. **Main Idea and Hypothesis:** The paper aims to develop a more accurate and reliable model for forecasting the temporal spread of COVID-19, particularly focusing on the relatively successful Greek case. The hypothesis is that a novel spline regression model, where knot placement is determined by complex network analysis (community detection in the visibility graph of the time series), will outperform traditional regression models (linear, polynomial) in terms of fitting accuracy and forecasting ability, especially with limited data.\n\n4. **Summary of Results:**  The study uses time-series data of COVID-19 infections, deaths, and ICU patients in Greece.  It first performs a correlation analysis showing significant relationships between these variables.  Then, it compares different regression models (linear, polynomial, spline) for fitting the data, finding that cubic polynomial models provide a good fit. To improve upon this, the authors introduce a novel spline regression model. The knot vector for this spline model is determined by identifying communities in the visibility graph constructed from the time series. This complex network-based approach to knot selection is argued to be superior to arbitrary or heuristic knot placement. The results demonstrate that the proposed complex-network-based spline model outperforms both the cubic polynomial models and spline models with randomly selected knots in terms of goodness-of-fit (R\u00b2, RMSE, RAE).  The authors suggest this improved performance stems from the ability of complex network analysis to handle complex system dynamics and reduce noise in the model.",
