Many countries lack sufficient surveillance systems. Usage of web mined data therefore has the potential to improve current surveillance methods.  This study investigates how well antimicrobial drug consumption can be predicted based on web search queries, compared to historical purchase data.  Two prediction models (linear Elastic Net, and non-linear Gaussian Processes) are trained and evaluated on almost 6 years of weekly data from Denmark.  A novel method of selecting web search queries is presented.\n3. **Main idea and hypothesis:** The main idea is to determine if web search query data can accurately predict antimicrobial drug consumption in Denmark, offering a cheaper and more timely alternative to traditional purchase data-based methods. The hypothesis is that antimicrobial drug consumption can be predicted from online search behavior, benefiting public health by enabling forecasting in countries lacking real-time data and aiding analysis of consumption determinants.\n4. **Summary of Results:** Predictions based on web search data were marginally less accurate but comparable to predictions based on purchase data (less than 1% point mean absolute error difference). Combining both web search and purchase data yielded the best predictions.  The study provides a novel alternative for predicting antimicrobial drug consumption, particularly valuable in countries lacking centralized surveillance systems.  Analysis of query selection showed that while semantically relevant queries were expected to perform best, spurious correlations sometimes yielded better results, likely due to seasonal patterns and limited data.\n\n\n**Chapter 3: Seasonal Web Search Query Selection for Influenza-Like Illness (ILI) Estimation**\n\n1. **Title:** Seasonal Web Search Query Selection for Influenza-Like Illness (ILI) Estimation\n2. **Abstract:**  ILI estimation from web search data is an important task. Current methods use queries correlated with past ILI activity, leading to spurious correlations due to seasonality. This paper proposes modeling seasonal ILI variation and selecting queries correlated with the residual of the seasonal model and the observed ILI signal.\n3. **Main idea and hypothesis:** The main idea is to improve ILI estimation by addressing spurious correlations caused by the seasonal nature of influenza. The hypothesis is that selecting queries based on their correlation with the residual between a seasonal model of ILI activity and actual ILI data will improve prediction accuracy and reduce reliance on irrelevant, seasonally correlated queries.\n4. **Summary of Results:** Re-ranking queries based on their correlation with the residual of a seasonal model (the difference between the model and actual ILI data) strongly favored ILI-related queries.  This resulted in improved estimation performance compared to baselines that did not account for seasonality, requiring fewer queries to achieve similar or better accuracy.  However, queries selected based on fitting the regular seasonal pattern performed better than queries fitting irregular patterns (outbreaks).\n\n\n**Chapter 4: Pre-Vaccination Care-Seeking in Females Reporting Severe Adverse Reactions to HPV Vaccine. A Registry Based Case-Control Study**\n\n1. **Title:** Pre-Vaccination Care-Seeking in Females Reporting Severe Adverse Reactions to HPV Vaccine. A Registry Based Case-Control Study\n2. **Abstract:** (Not provided in excerpt)\n3. **Main idea and hypothesis:** The main idea is to investigate whether there were differences in healthcare seeking behavior in the two years prior to HPV vaccination between females who subsequently reported severe adverse reactions and a matched control group. The hypothesis is that females who later reported severe adverse reactions to the HPV vaccine had a different pattern of healthcare seeking and symptoms before vaccination compared to the control group.\n4. **Summary of Results:** Females who reported severe adverse reactions had increased care-seeking in the two years before their first HPV vaccination compared to matched controls.  This included more telephone/email consultations, physiotherapy, and psychologist/psychiatrist visits.  They were also more likely to have diagnoses in certain ICD-10 chapters (digestive system diseases, musculoskeletal system diseases, symptoms/signs not classified elsewhere, and injuries). The conclusion emphasizes the importance of considering pre-vaccination morbidity when evaluating vaccine safety signals.\n\n\n**Chapter 5: Ensemble Learned Vaccination Uptake Prediction using Web Search Queries**\n\n1. **Title:** Ensemble Learned Vaccination Uptake Prediction using Web Search Queries\n2. **Abstract:** (Not provided in excerpt)\n3. **Main idea and hypothesis:** The main idea is to develop a method for predicting vaccination uptake using an ensemble of models combining clinical data (vaccination registries) and web-mined data (search query frequencies). The hypothesis is that combining clinical and web data through ensemble learning will improve the accuracy of vaccination uptake predictions compared to using either data source alone.\n4. **Summary of Results:** Ensemble methods combining clinical and web data outperformed methods using only clinical or web data for most vaccines.  However, the difference in accuracy between using only web data and using combined data was small for many vaccines, suggesting the potential of web data alone for prediction in areas lacking vaccination registries.  The best-performing ensemble method used Support Vector Regression with a Gaussian kernel.\n\n\n**Chapter 6: Time-Series Adaptive Estimation of Vaccination Uptake Using Web Search Queries**\n\n1. **Title:** Time-Series Adaptive Estimation of Vaccination Uptake Using Web Search Queries\n2. **Abstract:** Prior work estimates vaccination uptake from web data, assuming temporal regularity. This paper presents a method that dynamically adapts to temporal fluctuations in web data.  The method outperforms the state-of-the-art, especially for vaccines with irregular uptake patterns.\n3. **Main idea and hypothesis:** The main idea is to improve the accuracy of vaccination uptake estimation from web data by accounting for temporal irregularities in the data.  The hypothesis is that an online learning method that adapts to changes in the web data will improve prediction accuracy compared to methods assuming stationary time series.\n4. **Summary of Results:** The proposed adaptive time series estimation (ATSE) method outperformed baselines (Lasso and Elastic Net regression) for most vaccines. The improvement was particularly significant for vaccines with irregular uptake patterns (due to media attention, supply problems, or age-related variations in vaccination schedules).\n\n\n**Chapter 7: Investigating the Relationship Between Media Coverage and Vaccination Uptake in Denmark**\n\n1. **Title:** Investigating the Relationship Between Media Coverage and Vaccination Uptake in Denmark\n2. **Abstract:** (Not provided in excerpt)\n3. **Main idea and hypothesis:** The main idea is to investigate the relationship between media coverage (both volume and sentiment), measles incidence, and MMR vaccination uptake in Denmark. The hypothesis is that media coverage, particularly negative or neutral coverage, influences MMR vaccination uptake, especially during periods of public debate about vaccine safety.\n4. **Summary of Results:**  While no overall correlation was found between media coverage and vaccination uptake across the entire study period (1997-2014), a significant positive correlation was observed between pro-vaccination and neutral media and MMR-1 vaccination activity in the period immediately following the publication of the discredited Wakefield study (1998-2004).  This correlation was stronger for the first MMR vaccine.  The influence of media appears stronger when there is public debate on the topic.  Measles incidence was positively correlated with both pro-vaccination media and MMR-1 vaccination activity.\n\n\n**Chapter 8: Decline in HPV-vaccination Uptake in Denmark \u2013 The Association Between HPV-Related Media Coverage and HPV-Vaccination**\n\n1. **Title:** Decline in HPV-vaccination Uptake in Denmark \u2013 The Association Between HPV-Related Media Coverage and HPV-Vaccination\n2. **Abstract:** Following a successful launch, the HPV vaccination program in Denmark faced challenges due to suspected adverse events and increased critical media attention. This study describes HPV vaccination uptake, quantifies media coverage, and analyzes the relationship between them.\n3. **Main idea and hypothesis:** The main idea is to determine if increased negative media coverage regarding the HPV vaccine's safety is associated with the observed decline in vaccination uptake in Denmark. The hypothesis is that increased negative media attention regarding the HPV vaccine contributed to the decline in vaccination rates.\n4. **Summary of Results:** No significant relationship was found between media coverage and vaccination uptake in the early period (2010-June 2013). However, a significant negative correlation was found after July 2013, suggesting that increased negative media coverage influenced the decline in vaccination uptake.  Media monitoring is suggested as an important tool for assessing confidence in vaccination programs.",
