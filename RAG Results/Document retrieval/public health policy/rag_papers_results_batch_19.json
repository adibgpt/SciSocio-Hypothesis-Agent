The potential for misuse of data and the need for ethical guidelines are highlighted.\n\n\n**44. Beyond self-tracking: Exploring and unpacking four emerging labels of patient data work. Enrico Maria Piras**\n\n1. **Title:** Beyond self-tracking: Exploring and unpacking four emerging labels of patient data work\n\n2. **Abstract:** The abstract discusses the need to theorize data gathering and information management practices in healthcare.  It focuses on three labels: Patient-Generated Health Data (PGHD), Observations of Daily Living (ODLs), and Personal Health Information Management (PHIM), exploring how they represent different perspectives on health, patient-doctor relationships, and data status.\n\n3. **Main idea and hypothesis:** The main idea is to analyze the different conceptualizations and implications of PGHD, ODLs, and PHIM. The hypothesis is that these labels represent distinct approaches to patient data work, with different assumptions about the role of patients, providers, and the data itself.\n\n4. **Summary of Results:** The paper contrasts PGHD (provider-driven, structured data), ODLs (patient-defined, potentially unstructured data for self-management), and PHIM (patient activities to manage health information across various sources).  It argues that these labels are not interchangeable and reveal differing assumptions about patient care and data ownership.  The paper highlights challenges such as increased burden on both patients and providers, data fragmentation, and the need for patient-centered tools.\n\n\n\n**45. \u201d420 Friendly\u201d: Revealing Marijuana Use via Craigslist Rental Ads. Anh Nguyen, Long Nguyen, Dong Nguyen, Uyen Le, and Tuan Tran.**\n\n1. **Title:** \u201d420 Friendly\u201d: Revealing Marijuana Use via Craigslist Rental Ads\n\n2. **Abstract:** The abstract introduces a text-mining method to conduct public health surveillance of marijuana use using Craigslist rental ads.  It describes data scraping, text-mining methods for extracting marijuana-related ads, and comparison with government data and Google searches to verify findings.\n\n3. **Main idea and hypothesis:** The main idea is to leverage Craigslist rental ads to infer marijuana use patterns across the US. The hypothesis is that the frequency of marijuana-related terms in rental ads correlates with the legality and prevalence of marijuana use in different states.\n\n4. **Summary of Results:** The study found a strong correlation between Craigslist ads mentioning marijuana (especially \"420\"-related terms), Google searches for marijuana-related keywords, and state marijuana laws.  Interestingly, the study also found a significant number of marijuana-related ads in states where marijuana is illegal, suggesting a hidden world of marijuana use and potentially indicating the presence of a black market.\n\n\n**46. Explainable Machine Learning for Public Policy: Use Cases, Gaps, and Research Directions. Kasun Amarasinghe, Kit T. Rodolfa, Hemank Lamba, and Rayid Ghani.**\n\n1. **Title:** Explainable Machine Learning for Public Policy\n\n2. **Abstract:** The abstract highlights the need for explainable ML (XAI) in high-stakes policy decisions. It criticizes the lack of real-world evaluation of existing XAI methods and proposes a research agenda to address this gap.\n\n3. **Main idea and hypothesis:** The main idea is to identify the primary use cases of XAI in public policy, evaluate existing methods against these use cases, and propose research directions to bridge the gap between XAI research and real-world applications. The hypothesis is that a well-defined framework for XAI in policy settings will improve the design, evaluation, and deployment of effective ML systems.\n\n4. **Summary of Results:** The paper identifies five use cases for XAI in public policy: model debugging, building trust, deciding whether to intervene, deciding how to intervene, and recourse. It reviews existing XAI methods and finds that their effectiveness in real-world policy contexts is largely unproven due to a lack of rigorous evaluation studies using real-world data, real users, and application-grounded metrics. The paper proposes a research agenda to address this gap, emphasizing the importance of application-grounded evaluations that incorporate real policy tasks, domain experts, and robust inference strategies.  It also stresses the need for methods explicitly designed for specific use-cases and the importance of evaluating the performance-explainability trade-off for inherently interpretable models.",
