Note that some information (like full abstracts) is missing, and the summaries are based solely on the available excerpts.\n\n**Paper 1: Should we tweet this? Generative response modeling for predicting reception of public health messaging on Twitter**\n\n1. **Title:** Should we tweet this? Generative response modeling for predicting reception of public health messaging on Twitter\n\n2. **Abstract:** The way people respond to messaging from public health organizations on social media can provide insight into public perceptions on critical health issues, especially during a global crisis such as COVID-19.  It could be valuable for high-impact organizations such as the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) or the World Health Organization (WHO) to understand how these perceptions impact reception of messaging on health policy recommendations. We collect two datasets of public health messages and their responses from Twitter relating to COVID-19 and Vaccines, and introduce a predictive method which can be used to explore the potential reception of such messages. Specifically, we harness a generative model (GPT-2) to directly predict probable future responses and demonstrate how it can be used to optimize expected reception of important health guidance. Finally, we introduce a novel evaluation scheme with extensive statistical testing which allows us to conclude that our models capture the semantics and sentiment found in actual public health responses.\n\n3. **Main idea and hypothesis:** The paper investigates whether a generative language model (GPT-2) can accurately predict public responses to public health tweets on COVID-19 and vaccines.  The hypothesis is that GPT-2, trained on real Twitter responses, can generate responses that are semantically and sentimentally similar to actual responses, enabling public health organizations to anticipate public reaction to their tweets.\n\n4. **Summary of Results:** The GPT-2 model effectively captured the semantic and sentiment distributions of real responses to public health tweets in both datasets.  Statistical tests (AUC-REC, paired t-tests, correlation analysis) confirmed the model's ability to generate semantically and sentimentally similar responses.  The model's utility was higher for the COVID-19 dataset, suggesting greater value in predicting responses to less predictable topics.  A use case demonstrated how modifying a tweet's wording could significantly alter the predicted sentiment of responses.\n\n\n**Paper 2: Public Health Advocacy Dataset: A Dataset of Tobacco Usage Videos from Social Media**\n\n1. **Title:** Public Health Advocacy Dataset: A Dataset of Tobacco Usage Videos from Social Media\n\n2. **Abstract:** The Public Health Advocacy Dataset (PHAD) is a comprehensive collection of 5,730 videos related to tobacco products sourced from social media platforms like TikTok and YouTube. This dataset encompasses 4.3 million frames and includes detailed metadata such as user engagement metrics, video descriptions, and search keywords. This is the first dataset with these features providing a valuable resource for analyzing tobacco-related content and its impact. Our research employs a two-stage classification approach, incorporating a Vision-Language (VL) Encoder, demonstrating superior performance in accurately categorizing various types of tobacco products and usage scenarios. The analysis reveals significant user engagement trends, particularly with vaping and e-cigarette content, highlighting areas for targeted public health interventions. The PHAD addresses the need for multimodal data in public health research, offering insights that can inform regulatory policies and public health strategies. This dataset is a crucial step towards understanding and mitigating the impact of tobacco usage, ensuring that public health efforts are more inclusive and effective.\n\n3. **Main idea and hypothesis:** The paper introduces the Public Health Advocacy Dataset (PHAD), a new dataset of tobacco-related videos from YouTube and TikTok, and demonstrates its use in a two-stage classification model. The hypothesis is that a multimodal approach (combining visual and textual features) will improve the accuracy of classifying tobacco-related content in videos compared to unimodal methods.\n\n4. **Summary of Results:**  The PHAD dataset was created and successfully used to train a two-stage classification model incorporating a Vision-Language Encoder. This model outperformed baseline methods (including other vision-language models and a simpler approach) in classifying various types of tobacco products and usage scenarios. The analysis of the dataset revealed high user engagement with vaping and e-cigarette content.  Additional experiments compared the model's performance to GPT-4V and other architectures, further highlighting the effectiveness of the proposed two-stage approach.  The dataset is publicly available under a CC BY-NC-SA license.\n\n\n**Paper 3:  (No Title Provided in Excerpt)**\n\nThis excerpt focuses on calibrating epidemiological models using various optimization methods.  There is no clear title or abstract.\n\n3. **Main idea and hypothesis:** The main idea is to compare the performance of different optimization algorithms (Nelder-Mead, Powell, conjugate gradient, etc.) for calibrating parameters in epidemiological models (SIR, SIRD, SIRVD).  The implicit hypothesis is that some algorithms will perform better than others depending on factors like data availability, noise levels, and model complexity.\n\n4. **Summary of Results:** The results showed no single universally superior optimization method. Performance varied greatly depending on data quantity (low vs. high data regimes), the presence of noise, and the complexity of the epidemiological model.  Powell's method generally performed best in low-data scenarios, while Nelder-Mead excelled in high-data scenarios.  A bipartite graph summarizes the findings, suggesting optimal methods for different conditions.  The excerpt also introduces the concept of using reinforcement learning for model calibration, highlighting its potential benefits and challenges.",
