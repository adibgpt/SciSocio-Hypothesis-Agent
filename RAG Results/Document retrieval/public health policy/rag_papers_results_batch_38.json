Estimating public transport congestion in UK urban areas with open transport models**\n\n1. **Title:** Estimating public transport congestion in UK urban areas with open transport models\n2. **Abstract:** Operational urban transport models require heterogeneous datasets and integrate different sub-models, making validation and reproducible application problematic.  The paper proposes building bottom-up transport models using scientific workflow systems with open-source components and data to estimate public transport congestion in all UK urban areas. This allows building health indicators related to public transport density in the context of the COVID-19 crisis and testing related policies.\n3. **Main idea and hypothesis:** The hypothesis is that building urban transport models using open-source components and data within a scientific workflow system will improve model reproducibility, validation, and applicability across diverse UK urban areas. This will facilitate the creation of health indicators related to public transport and the testing of relevant policies.\n4. **Summary of Results:** The authors successfully built a modular four-step multimodal transportation model using open-source tools (MATSim, SPENSER, QUANT, spatialdata) within the DAFNI workflow system. Initial results demonstrated the model's ability to simulate trip departure times and distances across multiple UK urban areas. The model's open-source nature promotes reproducibility and facilitates educational applications. Future work will focus on developing health indicators related to public transport density and policy testing.\n\n\n**2. Increasing Herd Immunity with Influenza Revaccination**\n\n1. **Title:** Increasing Herd Immunity with Influenza Revaccination\n2. **Abstract:** (Not provided in excerpt)\n3. **Main idea and hypothesis:** The main idea is to investigate whether revaccination against seasonal influenza can increase herd immunity and reduce the size of subsequent epidemics.  The hypothesis is that increasing the rate of revaccination, even beyond initial vaccination coverage, will lead to a reduction in the size of subsequent influenza epidemics.\n4. **Summary of Results:** Simulation results indicated that increasing revaccination rates significantly reduced the size of second-season influenza epidemics. This effect was more pronounced when natural immunity was weaker and vaccine efficacy was higher.  The degree of vaccine coverage also influenced the effect of revaccination, with lower coverage leading to a more substantial impact. Network structure (size and degree distribution variance) also affected the relationship between revaccination and epidemic size.\n\n\n**3. Learn to Intervene: An Adaptive Learning Policy for Restless Bandits in Application to Preventive Healthcare**\n\n1. **Title:** Learn to Intervene: An Adaptive Learning Policy for Restless Bandits in Application to Preventive Healthcare\n2. **Abstract:**  In public health, patient adherence to programs is crucial.  Many beneficiaries disengage, necessitating timely interventions. The paper models this as a restless multi-armed bandit (RMAB) problem with unknown transition probabilities. A Whittle index-based Q-Learning (WIQL) mechanism is proposed and shown to converge to the optimal solution.\n3. **Main idea and hypothesis:** The hypothesis is that a model-free reinforcement learning approach (WIQL) can effectively learn an optimal intervention policy for a restless multi-armed bandit problem representing preventive healthcare, even without prior knowledge of the transition probabilities governing patient engagement.\n4. **Summary of Results:**  The WIQL algorithm, a Whittle index-based Q-learning method, was developed and proven to converge asymptotically to the optimal solution.  WIQL outperformed existing learning-based methods on benchmark problems and a maternal healthcare dataset, demonstrating its effectiveness in improving beneficiary engagement through targeted interventions.\n\n\n**4. Structured Actor-Critic for Managing Public Health Points-of-Dispensing**\n\n1. **Title:** Structured Actor-Critic for Managing Public Health Points-of-Dispensing\n2. **Abstract:** Public health organizations dispense treatments through points-of-dispensing (PODs) during emergencies.  The paper models this as a hierarchical Markov decision process (MDP) with inventory planner (upper-level) and dispensing coordinator (lower-level) decisions. A structured actor-critic algorithm is proposed, exploiting structure in the policy and value function, and proven to converge to optimality.  A naloxone case study is presented.\n3. **Main idea and hypothesis:** The hypothesis is that a structured actor-critic algorithm, leveraging structural properties of a hierarchical MDP model of public health resource dispensing, will efficiently learn near-optimal inventory control and dispensing policies, outperforming standard ADP methods.\n4. **Summary of Results:** A hierarchical MDP model was developed and analyzed, revealing structural properties (basestock-like policy and concave value function).  A novel structured actor-critic algorithm was proposed and proven to converge to the optimal solution with probability one.  Numerical experiments demonstrated superior convergence rates compared to other ADP algorithms (SPAR, actor-critic, policy gradient, Q-learning). An aggregation-based version was applied successfully to a naloxone distribution case study.\n\n\n**5. Social and behavioral determinants of health in the era of artificial intelligence with electronic health records: A scoping review**\n\n1. **Title:** Social and behavioral determinants of health in the era of artificial intelligence with electronic health records: A scoping review\n2. **Abstract:** Social and behavioral determinants of health (SBDH) significantly impact health outcomes.  Electronic health records (EHRs) and AI offer opportunities to leverage SBDH information, but methods are limited.  This scoping review analyzes SBDH categories, their relationship with health statuses, and NLP approaches for extracting SBDH from EHR data.\n3. **Main idea and hypothesis:** The main idea is to systematically review the literature on the use of AI, particularly NLP, to extract and utilize social and behavioral determinants of health (SBDH) information from electronic health records (EHRs) to improve health outcomes.  The underlying hypothesis is that AI techniques, especially NLP, can effectively extract relevant SBDH data from EHRs, enabling improved prediction models and ultimately better patient care.\n4. **Summary of Results:** The review identified 79 relevant studies.  Commonly studied SBDH factors included substance use, socioeconomic status, education, and social support, often linked to mental health, metabolic, and circulatory diseases.  NLP methods (rule-based, word embeddings, topic modeling, deep learning) were used to extract SBDH from EHRs, with varying degrees of success depending on the technique and the specific SBDH being targeted. Predictive models (regression, random forests, neural networks, SVMs) leveraged SBDH information to predict health outcomes.  The review highlights the potential of AI and NLP to improve understanding and management of SBDH but also points out the need for further research and standardization.",
