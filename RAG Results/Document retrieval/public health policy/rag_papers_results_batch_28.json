Title:** Learning Fair Policies for Infectious Diseases Mitigation using Path Integral Control\n\n**Abstract:** Infectious diseases pose major public health challenges to society, highlighting the importance of designing effective policies to reduce economic loss and mortality. In this paper, we propose a framework for sequential decision-making under uncertainty to design fairness-aware disease mitigation policies that incorporate various measures of unfairness. Specifically, our approach learns equitable vaccination and lockdown strategies based on a stochastic multi-group SIR model. To address the challenges of solving the resulting sequential decision-making problem, we adopt the path integral control algorithm as an efficient solution scheme. Through a case study, we demonstrate that our approach effectively improves fairness compared to conventional methods and provides valuable insights for policymakers.\n\n**Main idea and hypothesis:** The main idea is to develop a fairness-aware framework for designing optimal infectious disease mitigation policies. The hypothesis is that incorporating fairness considerations into a stochastic multi-group SIR model, solved using path integral control, will yield more equitable and effective policies compared to traditional homogeneous approaches.\n\n**Summary of Results:**  The authors demonstrate, through a COVID-19 case study, that their fairness-aware policies significantly improve equity in infection and mortality rates across different socioeconomic groups compared to homogeneous policies.  They find that fairness-aware policies prioritize vaccination in lower-income regions, achieving substantial fairness improvements with only marginal increases in overall costs.\n\n\n**2. Title:** Interpretable Feature Learning Framework for Smoking Behavior Detection\n\n**Abstract:** Smoking in public has been proven to be more harmful to non-smokers, making it a huge public health concern with urgent need for proactive measures and attention by authorities. With the world moving towards the 4th Industrial Revolution, there is a need for reliable eco-friendly detective measures towards this harmful intoxicating behavior to public health in and out of smart cities. We developed an Interpretable feature learning framework for smoking behavior detection which utilizes a Deep Learning VGG-16 pretrained network to predict and classify the input Image class and a Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP) to explain the network detection or prediction of smoking behavior based on the most relevant learned features/ pixels or neurons. The network\u2019s classification decision is based mainly on features located at the mouth especially the smoke seems to be of high importance to the network\u2019s decision. The outline of the \u2018smoke\u2019 is highlighted as evidence for the corresponding class. Some elements are seen as having a negative effect on the neuron \"smoke\" and are consequently highlighted differently. It is interesting to see that the network distinguishes important from unimportant features based on the image regions. The technology can also detect other smokeable drugs like weed, shisha, marijuana etc. The framework allows for reliable identification of action-based smokers in unsafe zones like schools, shopping malls, bus stops, railway compartments or other \u2018violated\u2019 places for smoking as per the government\u2019s regulatory health policies. With installation clearly defined in smoking zones, this technology can detect smokers out of range.\n\n**Main idea and hypothesis:** The paper aims to develop an interpretable deep learning model for detecting smoking behavior in public spaces.  The implicit hypothesis is that a VGG-16 network combined with Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP) will accurately classify smoking behavior from images and provide understandable explanations for its classifications.\n\n**Summary of Results:** The model achieved high accuracy (93.35%) in classifying smoking and non-smoking images.  LRP analysis revealed that the model primarily focuses on features around the mouth and the presence of smoke for its classification decisions.\n\n\n**3. Title:** REINFORCEMENT OF VACCINE MANDATES AND PUBLIC ATTITUDES TOWARDS VACCINES: WHAT CAN WE LEARN FROM GOOGLE SEARCH ACTIVITY?\n\n**Abstract:** International public health policies increasingly favor mandatory immunization. If its short-term effects on vaccine coverage are well documented, there has been little consideration to its effects on public attitudes towards vaccines. In this paper, we examine Google searches related to vaccines in five countries (Australia, France, Germany, Italy, Serbia) and two American states (California) which experienced at least one vaccine mandate extension in the past decade. We found that the effects of a new mandate implementation heavily depends on the context in each specific country or state. We also observed that there is little indication that the passing of new or extended mandates attenuated public doubt towards vaccines.\n\n**Main idea and hypothesis:** The paper investigates the relationship between the reinforcement of vaccine mandates and changes in public attitudes towards vaccines, as reflected in Google search data. The hypothesis is that changes in vaccine mandate policies will be associated with measurable changes in the volume and nature of online searches related to vaccines and their risks.\n\n**Summary of Results:** The study found that while mandate extensions often led to increased Google searches on both vaccination and vaccine risks,  they rarely resulted in a decrease in hesitancy-related searches.  The impact of mandates varied significantly across countries, suggesting that contextual factors play a crucial role in shaping public attitudes.  The authors emphasize the importance of considering national contexts and building public trust through communication, rather than relying solely on mandates to increase vaccination rates.\n\n\n**4. Title:** Modeling the prevalence of Schistosoma mansoni infection in an endemic population\n\n**Abstract:** We investigate theoretically if treatment alone can reduce the schistosomiasis\u2019s prevalence in an infected population, in a long-lasting sustainable way. We use a non-linear system of ordinary differential equations (a SI system combined with a logistic population growth) which describes the time evolution of the non-infected and infected populations, in terms of the recovering, infection, and demographic rates. Our model leads to the conclusion that the only way to eliminate this endemic disease is to implement public health policies aimed at both treatment and environment. We apply our model to the endemic area of Virgem das Gra\u00e7as, in Brazil, where the prevalence of Schistosiamisis in 2001 was greater than 50%. The epidemiological data are extracted from a longitudinal study carried on the region between 2001 and 2010 and the demographic parameter from official Brazilian population data. When these estimated parameters are entered, our model gives a limit prevalence for Virgem das Gra\u00e7as of 11%, which is still significantly high even though treatment in accordance to the government regulations is systematically performed. This estimative reinforces once again, that in order to eliminate Schistomiasis, public health policies aimed at treatment, sanitation, including snail control, and health education programs are mandatory.\n\n**Main idea and hypothesis:** The paper uses a mathematical model (a system of ordinary differential equations) to determine whether treatment alone can sustainably reduce the prevalence of Schistosoma mansoni infection.  The hypothesis is that treatment alone is insufficient for long-term reduction of schistosomiasis prevalence.\n\n**Summary of Results:** The model predicts that even with continuous treatment, the prevalence of infection will reach a limit, still significantly high (around 11% in the Virgem das Gra\u00e7as case study).  The authors conclude that eliminating schistosomiasis requires a multi-pronged approach combining treatment with environmental interventions (sanitation, snail control) and health education programs.\n\n\n**5. Title:** Cohort profile: the Northwest China Real-world and Population-based Cohort\n\n**Abstract:** (Not explicitly provided in excerpt)\n\n**Main idea and hypothesis:** The main idea is to describe a large-scale, population-based cohort study in Northwest China leveraging real-world data from various sources. The implicit hypothesis is that using readily available real-world data will allow for a more efficient and cost-effective creation of a large cohort study compared to traditional methods, while still providing valuable insights into chronic disease epidemiology, risk factors, and policy effectiveness.\n\n**Summary of Results:** The authors describe the creation and characteristics of a cohort study involving over 17 million participants from Northwest China.  The cohort integrates diverse data sources, including health profiles, examination records, electronic health records, mortality records, and environmental datasets.  They present an example analysis demonstrating the positive impact of a national health examination program on mortality and healthcare costs.  The authors highlight the strengths and limitations of the cohort, emphasizing its potential for future research.",
