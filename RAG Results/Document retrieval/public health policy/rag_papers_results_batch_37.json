Adverse Childhood Experiences Ontology for Mental Health Surveillance, Research, and Evaluation: Advanced Knowledge Representation and Semantic Web Techniques**\n\n1. **Title:** Adverse Childhood Experiences Ontology for Mental Health Surveillance, Research, and Evaluation: Advanced Knowledge Representation and Semantic Web Techniques\n\n2. **Abstract:**  Background: Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACEs) are linked to increased risks of negative health outcomes. Objective: To create an ontology to facilitate data integration and knowledge modeling for ACEs surveillance and research. Methods: Advanced knowledge representation and semantic Web tools were used. Results: The ACEs Ontology was implemented and made available via BioPortal.  Conclusions: The ACEs Ontology provides a uniform and reusable semantic network for improved ACEs surveillance and evaluation.\n\n3. **Main idea and hypothesis:** The paper hypothesizes that a formal ontology representing Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACEs) will improve data integration, knowledge modeling, and ultimately, surveillance and research efforts related to ACEs and their consequences.  The underlying assumption is that a lack of standardized data representation hinders the field's progress.\n\n4. **Summary of Results:** The researchers successfully created and made available the ACEs Ontology, a structured knowledge base expressed in OWL 2.  They demonstrated its usability through several use-case scenarios, showing its potential for improving data integration, analysis, and decision-making in clinical, research, and policy settings related to ACEs.\n\n\n**2. Health Care Crowds: Collective Intelligence in Public Health**\n\n1. **Title:** Health Care Crowds: Collective Intelligence in Public Health\n\n2. **Abstract:** This work explores the purposes for which crowds are being implemented in health care and the crowdsourcing methods used.  A systematic literature review of 110 research pieces reveals collective intelligence outcomes in three public health categories: health promotion, health research, and health maintenance, using all three known crowdsourcing forms. Potential implications and future research are discussed.\n\n3. **Main idea and hypothesis:** The paper hypothesizes that crowdsourcing methods are being effectively used in various aspects of public health and that analyzing the existing literature will reveal patterns in their application and effectiveness.\n\n4. **Summary of Results:** The analysis of 110 papers revealed that crowdsourcing is used in health promotion, research, and maintenance. Open collaboration was the most prevalent crowdsourcing method across all three areas.  The authors suggest further research to understand why open collaboration dominates and to explore the potential for cross-category learning between different applications of crowdsourcing in public health.\n\n\n**3. Beyond Ads: Sequential Decision-Making Algorithms in Law and Public Policy**\n\n1. **Title:** Beyond Ads: Sequential Decision-Making Algorithms in Law and Public Policy\n\n2. **Abstract:** The paper explores the application of sequential decision-making (SDM) algorithms (bandits, reinforcement learning, active learning) in law and public policy, highlighting the challenges that differ from private sector applications (\"advertisement fallacy\").  It argues that law and public policy pose unique methodological challenges that require addressing before widespread adoption. The paper provides examples across various public agencies, emphasizing the need for research to ensure policy compliance, adaptability, and effectiveness of SDM in the public sector.\n\n3. **Main idea and hypothesis:** The paper's central hypothesis is that existing SDM algorithms, largely developed for private sector applications like online advertising, are not directly transferable to the public sector due to unique constraints and challenges inherent in legal and policy contexts.\n\n4. **Summary of Results:** The paper identifies several key challenges: multi-objective decision-making, batched and delayed feedback, distribution shifts in small data regimes, learning with corrupted labels, feedback loops, and the need for rational and causal decision-making. It uses examples from various government agencies to illustrate these challenges and proposes avenues for future research to address these issues and move \"beyond ads.\"  The authors caution against the \"advertisement fallacy\" of directly applying private-sector algorithms to public sector problems without careful consideration of these unique challenges.\n\n\nI was unable to provide summaries for the remaining documents because they lacked abstracts or sufficient context for a meaningful summary.",
